<p>After completing this part, you should have a fully functioning dice game that
you can play on your terminal.</p>
<h2 id="primary-topics"><a class="header" href="#primary-topics">Primary Topics</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Simple conditional expressions</li>
<li>Simple iterative expressions</li>
<li>Simple functions</li>
<li>Simple data structures (arrays, strings)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prerequisites-and-setup"><a class="header" href="#prerequisites-and-setup">Prerequisites and Setup</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Complete projects 3 and 4. This assignment builds directly on the program
created for those projects.</li>
<li>Make sure you have <code>Dice.java</code> from projects 3 and 4.</li>
<li>Create a file named <code>DiceGame3.java</code> in your projects folder. You can either
start from scratch or copy your code from <code>DiceGame2.java</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="task-1-determine-your-rules"><a class="header" href="#task-1-determine-your-rules">Task 1: Determine Your Rules</a></h3>
<p>Choose one of the options below.</p>
<h4 id="option-1-default-yahtzee"><a class="header" href="#option-1-default-yahtzee">Option 1: (Default) Yahtzee</a></h4>
<p>If you choose this option, then you must complete the program by implementing
the remaining parts of Yahtzee. Your program must follow all of the standard
rules except for the "Yahtzee Bonus" rules in the official rules. In your
program, a Yahtzee should be treated like any other scoring category with no
special cases.</p>
<p>Program summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single user will play a full thirteen rounds of Yahtzee.</li>
<li>Each round will consist of a reroll phase and a score phase.
<ul>
<li>During the reroll phase the user can reroll their dice up to two times, and
they can choose which dice to reroll each time.</li>
<li>During the score phase the user must choose one unused score category to
determine how many points they receive for their dice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After thirteen rounds, the game will end and the user will see a final
scorecard showing their points in each category, as well as their total score.</li>
</ul>
<p>This option also requires your program to pass a set of tests. The
<a href="#additional-details">additional details</a> section has a list of requirements
that will be checked by the tests, and the structure provided by these
requirements may be helpful if you're having trouble writing this program
without the usual guided coding steps.</p>
<h4 id="option-2-custom-other-dice-game"><a class="header" href="#option-2-custom-other-dice-game">Option 2: (Custom) Other Dice Game</a></h4>
<p>If you're interested in designing an alternative program for this project, then
talk to me during class or office hours. It would require you to write a
detailed proposal for your version of the project, which would take the place of
the normal requirements in this project.</p>
<!-- If you choose this option, then you can implement a different dice game instead -->
<!-- of finishing Yahtzee. This can be a game you designed or an existing game. I -->
<!-- expect the game you implement to be similar in complexity to Yahtzee. A simple -->
<!-- game that takes little effort to code is not appropriate for this project. Feel -->
<!-- free to ask me about your game before submitting a proposal if you're not sure -->
<!-- whether I will allow you to use it. -->
<!---->
<!-- This option exempts you from the I/O requirements, the function requirements, -->
<!-- and the tests for this project. It requires an approved proposal before you -->
<!-- start working on or submit the project. -->
<!---->
<!-- Your proposal must answer the following questions: -->
<!---->
<!-- 1. Explain the rules of your game in enough detail that I or another person -->
<!--    could play your game using real dice. If you are using an existing game, then -->
<!--    you can summarize the rules (in your own words), state any changes you are -->
<!--    making to the rules, and link to the official rules or another source that -->
<!--    explains them in detail. I expect you to play your game a few times to ensure -->
<!--    you understand the rules and that any rules you changed or designed yourself -->
<!--    work in practice. -->
<!-- 2. Explain how the user would interact with your program. Describe any commands -->
<!--    or input the user would be expected to type while using the program and how -->
<!--    the program should respond. -->
<!-- 3. Describe three new functions you expect to create while implementing this -->
<!--    program. What do these functions do, what parameters do they require, and -->
<!--    what (if anything) do they return? These must be new functions that did not -->
<!--    already exist in 2.1 or 2.2, not modified versions of functions you wrote for -->
<!--    those programs. -->
<!---->
<!-- Your answers to questions 2 and 3 may change as you write your program, and -->
<!-- that's okay! As long as your game's rules remain the same, you do not need to -->
<!-- submit a new proposal. You will address changes to the functions and user input -->
<!-- in the writeup task. -->
<h3 id="task-2-implement-your-program"><a class="header" href="#task-2-implement-your-program">Task 2: Implement Your Program</a></h3>
<p>If you chose the default option, then refer to the
<a href="#additional-details">additional details</a> section for specific requirements.</p>
<p>If you chose the custom option, then you should refer to your accepted proposal
for specific requirements and ignore the additional details section of this
assignment.</p>
<h4 id="updating-main"><a class="header" href="#updating-main">Updating <code>main</code></a></h4>
<p>To help you get started, here's an outline of the <code>main</code> function for the
default version of the program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create the following arrays, which will be passed to and used by other
functions in your program:
<ul>
<li>an array of thirteen strings for the category names</li>
<li>an array of thirteen ints for the category scores</li>
<li>an array of thirteen booleans for the availability of these categories and
set each element to <code>true</code></li>
<li>an array of five ints for the dice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a loop to play thirteen rounds of the game, which should:
<ul>
<li>Print the round number</li>
<li>Roll the dice</li>
<li>Call <code>rerollPhase</code></li>
<li>Call <code>scorePhase</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Print the final score card after the loop terminates.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="task-3-run-tests"><a class="header" href="#task-3-run-tests">Task 3: Run Tests</a></h3>
<p>If you chose the default version of this assignment, then run the tests for your
project and look at the feedback. If your code passed every test, then this step
is finished.</p>
<p>If you chose the custom version, then you should not attempt to test it with my
test program. Instead, you should run your program enough to be confident that
it works correctly under normal circumstances. If it is difficult for me to use
your program without encountering significant bugs or errors, then you will have
to revise and resubmit the project.</p>
<h3 id="task-4-write-up"><a class="header" href="#task-4-write-up">Task 4: Write-Up</a></h3>
<p>After completing the program, answer the questions below in a separate document.
<strong>This is not an essay: do NOT double-space, and keep your answers to each
question separate</strong>. Your answers should be reasonably detailed and address each
question in full. I expect you to be accurate when describing your project, but
I'm otherwise not concerned with whether you provide the "correct" answer to a
question. Much of what I'm asking you for is your opinion or analysis of your
work. I want to know what <em>you</em> think so that I can assess your understanding
and provide useful feedback. If I disagree with you, then I will explain why and
offer suggestions without penalizing your grade.</p>
<p>Also, an important reminder: <strong>do not use ChatGPT or another LLM to assist with
or complete the write-up for you</strong>. The whole point is for you to think
critically about and explain your code. I do not care what ChatGPT "thinks"
about your work. Form your own opinions and justify them as best you can.</p>
<ol>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that was either challenging to
write or that you think is an example of particularly good code (it's up to you
what "good code" means, but you should be able to justify your opinion). Explain
why you chose this code: why is it an example of good code or what was
challenging about writing it? Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) and file where it appears in your program.</li>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that you think could be improved.
What do you dislike or want to change about this code? If you were to spend more
time on the project, how might you improve this code? To be clear, I'm not
asking you how the <em>program</em> could be better. I don't want to know what feature
you'd add or how you'd make it easier to use. I'm asking how part of the <em>code</em>
could be better. This might mean shorter, easier to read, less repetitive, or
something else that you value and think you could improve with additional time
and/or programming knowledge. Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) and file where it appears in your program.</li>
</ol>
<!-- Additionally, answer the following questions if you designed your own program: -->
<!---->
<!-- 3. Explain how to use your program. You can assume the user has read the rules -->
<!--    of your dice game, but don't assume they know anything about how to use your -->
<!--    program yet. These directions and your program's prompts must be sufficient -->
<!--    for someone to learn how to use your program without reading any of the code. -->
<!--    If your prompts are good, then you may not need to write much for this -->
<!--    question! -->
<!-- 4. What changes, if any, did you make to the user input you described in your -->
<!--    proposal? Why did you make these changes? -->
<!-- 5. What changes, if any, did you make to the functions you described in your -->
<!--    proposal? Why did you make these changes? -->
<h2 id="deliverables"><a class="header" href="#deliverables">Deliverables</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Your <code>DiceGame3.java</code> file</li>
<li>Your writeup</li>
<li>Any other material you created for this project (only relevant if you chose
the custom option in part 1)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="additional-details"><a class="header" href="#additional-details">Additional Details</a></h2>
<p>This section covers the requirements for anyone who chose the default option. If
you went with the custom option, then you can ignore this part of the
assignment.</p>
<h3 id="io-format"><a class="header" href="#io-format">I/O Format</a></h3>
<p>This program must meet the following I/O requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The program accepts the required input in the order shown in the assignment
and does not expect any additional input.</li>
<li>The program produces each line of required output in the order specified in
the assignment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The program may include additional output before, between, and after lines of
required output. This additional output must be on a separate line from any
required output.</p>
<p>Your program must accept the same user input as in Project 4 for every round of
the game. There will be 13 rounds in a full game.</p>
<p>Your program must print the same output as in Project 4, but with the following
changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the beginning of each round print "Round X", where X is the round number
(starting at 1)</li>
<li>During the score phase:
<ul>
<li>A list of options produced by this project's version of the <code>printScore</code>
function</li>
<li>The message "ERROR: INVALID CATEGORY" when user chooses a category that
isn't a number from 1 to 13</li>
<li>The message "ERROR: CATEGORY UNAVAILABLE" when the user chooses a category
that was already taken</li>
<li>The number of points received for the chosen category and that category's
name formatted as "You receive X points for Y."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After the final round:
<ul>
<li>The line "Final Score Card:"</li>
<li>The output of the <code>printScore</code> function</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, your program should include reasonable prompts for information and
any additional text that you think would make it easier for the user to interact
with the program. It's up to you how much of this to include, what exactly to
say, and how to format it. The tests will not check these prompts.</p>
<h3 id="random-numbers"><a class="header" href="#random-numbers">Random Numbers</a></h3>
<p>See <a href="./project3.html#random-numbers">Project 3</a>.</p>
<h3 id="functions"><a class="header" href="#functions">Functions</a></h3>
<p>Your program must include all of the functions described below <strong>in addition to
the functions required in <a href="./project3.html#functions">Project 3</a> and
<a href="./project4.html#functions">Project 4</a></strong>. If a function from Project 3 or 4

</ul>
<p>Must perform the following process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display the score options, their availability, and how many points each option
is worth (call <code>printScores</code>)</li>
<li>Read integers from the user until they enter a number from one to thirteen
that corresponds to an available category, displaying an error message for
each invalid input</li>
<li>Calculate and print the score for the category chosen by the user</li>
<li>Store the score in the scores array</li>
<li>Mark the category as unavailable</li>
