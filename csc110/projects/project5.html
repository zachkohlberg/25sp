<p>You will modify the character creation rules and implement more interesting
methods of generating a character's stats. This will be a compiled Java program,
not a Jshell script.</p>

<ul>
<li>Complete projects 1 and 2. I also recommend completing projects 3 and 4
because this program makes frequent use of both functions and arrays, which
are the focus of those projects.</li>
<li>Make sure you have <code>Dice.java</code> from projects 3 and 4.</li>
<li>Create a file named <code>CharacterSheet3.java</code> in your projects folder. You can
either start from scratch or copy your code from <code>CharacterSheet2.java</code>.</li>

<h2 id="tasks"><a class="header" href="#tasks">Tasks</a></h2>
<h3 id="task-1-program-design"><a class="header" href="#task-1-program-design">Task 1: Program Design</a></h3>
<p>Choose one of the options below.</p>
<h4 id="option-1-default-dd-5e-rules"><a class="header" href="#option-1-default-dd-5e-rules">Option 1: (Default) D&amp;D 5e Rules</a></h4>
<p>If you choose this option, then you must make the changes summarized below:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will split your program into separate <a href="#functions">functions</a>.</li>
<li>The user will have six options for their class and ancestry:
<ul>
<li>Ancestries: Dragonborn, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Halfling, or Human</li>
<li>Classes: Barbarian, Bard, Cleric, Fighter, Rogue, or Wizard</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The character will have six ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution,
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.</li>
<li>The user can choose to either roll their ability scores or use 5e's point buy
system.
<ul>
<li>Roll: the program will simulate rolling four six-sided dice for each ability
score, dropping the lowest die and summing the remaining three.</li>
<li>Point Buy: the user spends points to purchase ability scores. They can
select any score from 8 to 15 as long as they have enough points left to buy
that score.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This option also requires your program to pass a set of tests. The
<a href="#additional-details">additional details</a> section has a list of requirements
that will be checked by the tests, and the structure provided by these
requirements may be helpful if you're having trouble writing this program
without the usual guided coding steps.</p>
<h4 id="option-2-custom-new-rules"><a class="header" href="#option-2-custom-new-rules">Option 2: (Custom) New Rules</a></h4>
<p>If you're interested in designing an alternative program for this project, then
talk to me during class or office hours. It would require you to write a
detailed proposal for your version of the project, which would take the place of
the normal requirements in this project.</p>
<!---->
<!-- If you choose this option, then you will design a new set of character creation -->
<!-- rules. This doesn't have to be related to D&D, and the rules don't even have to -->
<!-- be for a game. You could create a user account for a fictional social media app, -->
<!-- a profile for a professional athlete, or anything else you can think of. -->
<!---->
<!-- Your new design must meet the following requirements: -->
<!---->
<!-- - Your program generates additional information from the user's input. We want -->
<!--   our program to make creating this character (or account, profile, whatever) -->
<!--   more convenient for the user than if they did it by hand, so it should do a -->
<!--   reasonable amount of work for them. For example, the default program applies -->
<!--   adjustments to the character's ability scores and calculates their ability -->
<!--   modifiers. The user doesn't have to perform or understand these calculations -->
<!--   to create a character with that program. -->
<!-- - Your program includes one or two "advanced" features that either implement -->
<!--   more complex rules than the formulas and error-checking from 1.2 or allow the -->
<!--   user to do something with their character after it's finished. Some examples: -->
<!--   - the point-buy calculator in the default version of this project -->
<!--   - a quiz that determines some of your character's stats, like you might see in -->
<!--     older RPGs -->
<!--   - the ability to simulate skill checks, attacks, and other rolls you'd -->
<!--     commonly make while playing the game -->
<!---->
<!-- This program doesn't need to be realistic or practical. It only needs to make -->
<!-- sense in whatever scenario you have imagined for it. For example, the default -->
<!-- program doesn't come close to making a complete D&D character, but it still -->
<!-- accurately implements most of the character creation rules it does use. You -->
<!-- could use a character created with that program as a starting point for a real -->
<!-- D&D character. -->
<!---->
<!-- I expect this program to be similar in complexity to the default version of the -->
<!-- assignment. You shouldn't need to go out of your way to make it complicated, but -->
<!-- don't try to use this option to trivialize the assignment. If your proposed -->
<!-- rules are too simple, then I will provide feedback and ask you to revise your -->
<!-- proposal. -->
<!---->
<!-- This option exempts you from the I/O requirements, the function requirements, -->
<!-- and the tests for this project. It requires an approved proposal before you -->
<!-- start working on or submit the project. -->
<!---->
<!-- Your proposal must answer the following questions: -->
<!---->
<!-- 1. Explain the premise of this program. What kind of character (or profile, -->
<!--    etc.) are we creating, and how would we use it? If it's related to something -->
<!--    that already exists (such as another game or intellectual property), then -->
<!--    feel free to link to some sources that explain it in more detail. -->
<!-- 2. Explain the advanced feature(s) you will include in the program. Be specific -->
<!--    and provide enough detail for me to replicate the process by hand. -->
<!-- 3. What information will the user provide to your program? What does this -->
<!--    information tell the program about the user? Include _all_ information you -->
<!--    expect the user to provide. -->
<!-- 4. What information will the program generate from the user's input? How will it -->
<!--    generate this information? Be specific and provide enough detail for me to -->
<!--    replicate this process by hand. -->
<h3 id="task-2-implement-your-program"><a class="header" href="#task-2-implement-your-program">Task 2: Implement Your Program</a></h3>
<p>If you chose the default option, then refer to the
<a href="#additional-details">additional details</a> section for specific requirements.</p>
<p>If you chose the custom option, then you should refer to your accepted proposal
for specific requirements and ignore the additional details section of this
assignment.</p>
<h3 id="task-3-run-tests"><a class="header" href="#task-3-run-tests">Task 3: Run Tests</a></h3>
<p>If you chose the default version of this assignment, then run the tests for your
project and look at the feedback. If your code passed every test, then this step
is finished.</p>
<p>If you chose the custom version, then you should not attempt to test it with my
test program. Instead, you should run your program enough to be confident that
it works correctly under normal circumstances. If it is difficult for me to use
your program without encountering significant bugs or errors, then you will have
to revise and resubmit the project.</p>
<h3 id="task-4-write-up"><a class="header" href="#task-4-write-up">Task 4: Write-Up</a></h3>
<p>After completing the program, answer the questions below in a separate document.
<strong>This is not an essay: do NOT double-space, and keep your answers to each
question separate</strong>. Your answers should be reasonably detailed and address each
question in full. I expect you to be accurate when describing your project, but
I'm otherwise not concerned with whether you provide the "correct" answer to a
question. Much of what I'm asking you for is your opinion or analysis of your
work. I want to know what <em>you</em> think so that I can assess your understanding
and provide useful feedback. If I disagree with you, then I will explain why and
offer suggestions without penalizing your grade.</p>
<p>Also, an important reminder: <strong>do not use ChatGPT or another LLM to assist with
or complete the write-up for you</strong>. The whole point is for you to think
critically about and explain your code. I do not care what ChatGPT "thinks"
about your work. Form your own opinions and justify them as best you can.</p>
<ol>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that was either challenging to
write or that you think is an example of particularly good code (it's up to you
what "good code" means, but you should be able to justify your opinion). Explain
why you chose this code: why is it an example of good code or what was
challenging about writing it? Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) and file where it appears in your program.</li>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that you think could be improved.
What do you dislike or want to change about this code? If you were to spend more
time on the project, how might you improve this code? To be clear, I'm not
asking you how the <em>program</em> could be better. I don't want to know what feature
you'd add or how you'd make it easier to use. I'm asking how part of the <em>code</em>
could be better. This might mean shorter, easier to read, less repetitive, or
something else that you value and think you could improve with additional time
and/or programming knowledge. Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) and file where it appears in your program.</li>
</ol>
<!-- Additionally, answer the following question if you designed your own program: -->
<!---->
<!-- 3. Explain how to use your program. These directions and your program's prompts -->
<!--    must be sufficient for someone to learn how to use your program without -->
<!--    reading any of the code. If your prompts are good, then you may not need to -->
<!--    write much for this question! -->

<h3 id="rulescalculations"><a class="header" href="#rulescalculations">Rules/Calculations</a></h3>
<p>This section covers all of the D&amp;D rules and calculations that your program must
implement. Other sections may refer to these requirements.</p>
<h4 id="ability-scores-rolling"><a class="header" href="#ability-scores-rolling">Ability Scores: Rolling</a></h4>
<p>The user can choose to roll their ability scores. Rolling each score uses the
following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roll four six-sided dice</li>
<li>Remove the die with the lowest value (in case of a tie, only remove one die)</li>
<li>Sum the remaining three dice to determine the ability score</li>
</ul>
<p>This method produces scores between 3 and 18 (inclusive). This allows for lower
and higher scores than a player could normally get through point buy, but the
player has less control over their scores. Our program is also assigning the
scores in the order they were rolled rather than letting the player assign them.</p>
<h4 id="ability-scores-point-buy"><a class="header" href="#ability-scores-point-buy">Ability Scores: Point Buy</a></h4>
<p>The user can choose to use D&amp;D 5e's point buy system to determine their ability
scores. The point buy system has the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user has a budget of 27 points to spend on their ability scores.</li>
<li>Each ability score defaults to 8 until the user changes it.</li>
<li>The user can choose any integer from 8 to 15 (inclusive) for an ability score,
provided they have enough points remaining to purchase that score. The score
costs are as follows:</li>
</ul>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Score</th><th>Point Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>8</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>7</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>9</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<h4 id="ancestry-adjustments"><a class="header" href="#ancestry-adjustments">Ancestry Adjustments</a></h4>
<p>The following table shows the ability score adjustments for each ancestry.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Ancestry</th><th>Str</th><th>Dex</th><th>Con</th><th>Int</th><th>Wis</th><th>Cha</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Dragonborn</td><td>+2</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>+1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dwarf</td><td></td><td></td><td>+2</td><td></td><td>+1</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Elf</td><td></td><td>+2</td><td></td><td>+1</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Gnome</td><td></td><td>+2</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>+1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Halfling</td><td></td><td>+2</td><td></td><td></td><td>+1</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Human</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<h4 id="ability-modifiers"><a class="header" href="#ability-modifiers">Ability Modifiers</a></h4>
<p>After adjusting a character's ability scores for their ancestry, we calculate
each ability's modifier. The score's main purpose is to determine this modifier,
whereas the modifier is the number we use for all of our calculations (hp, ac,
etc.). The table below shows the modifier for each possible ability score a
character can have in this program, but you can also calculate an ability's
modifier with the formula <code>modifier = score / 2 - 5</code>.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Score</th><th>Modifier</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>3</td><td>-4</td></tr>
<tr><td>4-5</td><td>-3</td></tr>
<tr><td>6-7</td><td>-2</td></tr>
<tr><td>8-9</td><td>-1</td></tr>
<tr><td>10-11</td><td>+0</td></tr>
<tr><td>12-13</td><td>+1</td></tr>
<tr><td>14-15</td><td>+2</td></tr>
<tr><td>16-17</td><td>+3</td></tr>
<tr><td>18-19</td><td>+4</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>+5</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<h4 id="classes"><a class="header" href="#classes">Classes</a></h4>
<p>The following table shows the properties of each class.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Class</th><th>Hit Die</th><th>AC Formula</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Barbarian</td><td>d12</td><td>10 + Dex + Con</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bard</td><td>d8</td><td>12 + Dex</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cleric</td><td>d8</td><td>15 + min(Dex, 2)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fighter</td><td>d10</td><td>18</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rogue</td><td>d8</td><td>12 + Dex</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wizard</td><td>d6</td><td>10 + Dex</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>All ability names in the AC formula refer to that ability's <em>modifier</em>, not its
score.</p>
<p>A note about the cleric's AC: we add 15 to either the cleric's dexterity
modifier or 2, whichever is less. This limits the cleric's dexterity modifier to
+2 or less for the purpose of calculating their armor class. You can use the
<code>Math.min</code> function to take the lower of two numbers.</p>
<h4 id="hit-points"><a class="header" href="#hit-points">Hit Points</a></h4>
<p>A character's hit points can be calculated by rolling their hit die or taking an
average value for each level. A hit die is written as "d" followed by the number
of sides on the die. For example, "d12" refers to a twelve-sided die. To
calculate a character's hit points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the maximum value (the number of sides on the die) for first level,
regardless of whether you are rolling or taking the average.</li>
<li>For each level after first:
<ul>
<li>If rolling, then roll the hit die and add the character's constitution
modifier to the result</li>
<li>If taking the average, then use 1 + half the die size + the character's
constitution modifier</li>
<li>A character gains a minimum of 1 hit point per level. If the constitution
modifier is negative, then you need to make sure the result for any given
level is not less than 1. One way to do this is to use <code>Math.max</code> to take
the larger value between 1 and the number you calculated in the previous
step.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, let's calculate the hit points of a 3rd level fighter with a
constitution modifier of -2. In the class table we can see that a fighter's hit
die is d10.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rolling (let's assume I roll a 2 and a 7 on a d10)
<ul>
<li>The fighter gains 8 hp at first level: 10 (max hit die value) plus -2 (con)</li>
<li>The fighter gains 1 hp at second level: 2 (number rolled on a d10) plus -2
(con) is less than 1, but a character must gain a minimum of 1 hp per level</li>
<li>The fighter gains 5 hp at second level: 7 (number rolled on a d10) plus -2
(con)</li>
<li>Total hp: 14</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Average
<ul>
<li>The fighter gains 8 hp at first level: 10 (max hit die value) plus -2 (con)</li>
<li>The fighter gains 4 hp at second and third level: 6 (half hit die plus one)
plus -2 (con)</li>
<li>Total hp: 16</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="io-format"><a class="header" href="#io-format">I/O Format</a></h3>
<p>This program must meet the following I/O requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The program accepts the required input in the order shown in the assignment
and does not expect any additional input.</li>
<li>The program produces each line of required output in the order specified in
the assignment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The program may include additional output before, between, and after lines of
required output. This additional output must be on a separate line from any
required output.</p>
<p>Your program must accept the following user input:</p>
<ul>
<li>(String) player's name</li>
<li>(String) character's name</li>
<li>(String) character's ancestry</li>
<li>(String) character's class</li>
<li>(int) character's level</li>
<li>(int) either "1" or "2" to indicate whether the user wishes to (1) roll their
hit points or (2) use average hit points</li>
<li>(int) either "1" or "2" to indicate whether the user wishes to generate their
scores with (1) point buy or (2) dice roll</li>
</ul>
<p>If the user chooses point buy, then your program must accept the following
input, which will repeat until the user finishes purchasing ability scores:</p>
<ul>
<li>Either an ability (the three-letter abbreviation, all lowercase) or the word
"done", which indicates that the user is finished with the point buy process.
If the user types "done", then no more input will follow.</li>
<li>A new score for the chosen ability (int)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the user enters invalid input of the correct type (for example, a level of -3
or a class of "knight"), then the program must print "Invalid choice, try
again." and make the user re-enter that piece of input. This message and reread
must repeat until the user enters valid input. You <strong>do not</strong> have to do this
for the wrong <em>type</em> of input, such as the user entering a level of "abc". That
would require exception handling, which you aren't expected to know for this
project.</p>
<p>Your program must print the following output during each iteration of the
point-buy process:</p>
<ul>
<li>The current value of each ability score formatted as the ability name's
three-letter abbreviation followed by the score. There must be a space after
the ability name, and the score must be right-aligned. These should also
(optionally) be indented.</li>
<li>The current budget, formatted as "Budget: X out of 27 points spent.". Replace
X with the total cost of the current set of ability scores.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example of the point-buy output:</p>
<pre><code>Budget: 20 out of 27 points spent.
    Str 15
    Dex  8
    Con 10
    Int 11
    Wis  9
    Cha 13
</code></pre>
<p>Your program must also print a warning if the user tries to exceed their budget
when setting a score. Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code>You can't afford to change dex from 8 to 15.
</code></pre>
<p>Your program must print the following output when displaying the character
sheet:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Player: </code> followed by the player name</li>
<li><code>Character: ___, level ___, ___ ___</code>, replacing the blanks with the
character's name, level, ancestry (lowercase), and class (lowercase) in that
order</li>
<li><code>HP: ___, AC: ___</code>, replacing the blanks with the character's hit points and
armor class</li>
<li><code>Proficiency: +</code> followed by the character's proficiency bonus</li>
<li><code>Abilities:</code></li>
<li>Each ability's three-letter abbreviation, score, and modifier indented and
formatted as they were in the previous project</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example of the character sheet output:</p>
<pre><code>Player: Alice
Character: Bob, level 15 elf bard
HP: 73, AC: 15
Proficiency: +5
Abilities:
    Str 15 (+2)
    Dex 16 (+3)
    Con 10 (+0)
    Int 12 (+1)
    Wis  9 (-1)
    Cha 13 (+1)
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, you should include appropriate prompts throughout your program when
expecting user input. These prompts are ignored by the tests and should not
affect whether your program passes or fails any of them, so you can phrase these
prompts however you wish.</p>
<h3 id="random-numbers"><a class="header" href="#random-numbers">Random Numbers</a></h3>
<p>To ensure compatibility with my tests, there are a few additional requirements
whenever you have to generate a random number:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each random number is generated by a function from the <code>Dice</code> class.</li>
<li>Your program "rolls" dice in the order implied by the rest of these
directions. For example, when you are rolling ability scores you should roll
them in the listed order: first strength, then dexterity, then constitution,
and so on.</li>
<li>Your program does not roll extra dice. For example, calling one of the Dice
class's functions to generate a random number when you don't need to roll a
die, or rolling each die twice instead of once.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="functions"><a class="header" href="#functions">Functions</a></h3>
<p>Your program must include all of the functions described below.</p>
<p>Unless they are required to handle specific errors, your functions can assume
that all of their parameters contain valid input.</p>
<h4 id="rollabilityscores"><a class="header" href="#rollabilityscores"><code>rollAbilityScores</code></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Return type: <code>int[]</code></li>
<li>Parameters: none</li>
</ul>
<p>Must create and return an array of six integers representing a character's
ability scores. Must generate each score by simulating four six-sided dice rolls
and summing the three highest rolls.</p>
<h4 id="purchaseabilityscores"><a class="header" href="#purchaseabilityscores"><code>purchaseAbilityScores</code></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Return type: <code>int[]</code></li>
<li>Parameters: <strong>none</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Must create and return an array of six integers representing a character's
ability scores. The user will set the scores following the standard point buy
rules for D&amp;D 5th edition.</p>
<p>Must repeat the following process until the user is finished:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display the current ability scores and point budget.</li>
<li>Prompt the user for either an ability (the three-letter abbreviation) or the
word "done", which will end the process and return the current set of ability
scores.</li>
<li>Prompt the user to enter a new score for the chosen ability. This must be an
integer between 8 and 15 (inclusive).</li>
<li>If the user has enough points left in their budget to set the chosen ability
to the chosen score, then the ability score and point budget must update.</li>
<li>If the user does not have enough points, then the program will print "You
can't afford to change ABILITY from OLD to NEW." before continuing. <code>ABILITY</code>
must be replaced with the abbreviated name of the ability, <code>OLD</code> must be
replaced with the current score, and <code>NEW</code> must be replaced with the new score
entered by the user.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="applyancestryadjustments"><a class="header" href="#applyancestryadjustments"><code>applyAncestryAdjustments</code></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Return type: <code>void</code></li>
<li>Parameters:
<ul>
<li>A <code>String</code> representing the character's ancestry</li>
<li>An <code>int</code> array containing the ability scores</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Must adjust the ability scores based on the given ancestry. This method changes
elements in its array parameter and does not create or return a new array.</p>
<p>If your function receives an invalid ancestry, then it doesn't have to do
anything.</p>
<h4 id="calculateabilitymodifiers"><a class="header" href="#calculateabilitymodifiers"><code>calculateAbilityModifiers</code></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Return type: <code>int[]</code></li>
<li>Parameters:
<ul>
<li>An <code>int</code> array containing the character's ability scores</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Must return an array containing the modifier derived from each ability score.
The modifiers must be in the same order as the scores.</p>
<h4 id="gethitdie"><a class="header" href="#gethitdie"><code>getHitDie</code></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Return type: <code>int</code></li>
<li>Parameters:
<ul>
<li>A <code>String</code> representing the character's class</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Must return the size of the hit die for the given class.</p>
<p>If your function receives an invalid class, then it can return 4.</p>
<h4 id="rollhitpoints"><a class="header" href="#rollhitpoints"><code>rollHitPoints</code></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Return type: <code>int</code></li>
<li>Parameters:
<ul>
<li>A <code>String</code> representing the character's class</li>
<li>An <code>int</code> representing the character's level</li>
<li>An <code>int</code> array containing the character's ability modifiers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Must calculate and return the character's hit points using the rolling method
described for hit points.</p>
<p>Remember that your program must simulate random dice rolls by calling the
appropriate method from the <code>Dice</code> class, and it must not simulate more dice
rolls than necessary. This is required to keep your code compatible with the
test program.</p>
<h4 id="averagehitpoints"><a class="header" href="#averagehitpoints"><code>averageHitPoints</code></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Return type: <code>int</code></li>
<li>Parameters:
<ul>
<li>A <code>String</code> representing the character's class</li>
<li>An <code>int</code> representing the character's level</li>
<li>An <code>int</code> array containing the character's ability modifiers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Must calculate and return the character's hit points using the average method
described for hit points.</p>
<h4 id="calculatearmorclass"><a class="header" href="#calculatearmorclass"><code>calculateArmorClass</code></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Return type: <code>int</code></li>
<li>Parameters:
<ul>
<li>A <code>String</code> representing the character's class</li>
<li>An <code>int</code> array containing the character's ability modifiers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Calculate and return the character's armor class.</p>
<p>If your function receives an invalid class, then it can return whichever number
you want. 10 is a good default value, but the tests will only provide valid
class names.</p>
<h4 id="createcharactersheet"><a class="header" href="#createcharactersheet"><code>createCharacterSheet</code></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Return type: <code>void</code></li>
<li>Parameters:
<ul>
<li>A <code>String</code> representing the player's name</li>
<li>A <code>String</code> representing the character's name</li>
<li>A <code>String</code> representing the character's ancestry</li>
<li>A <code>String</code> representing the character's class</li>
<li>An <code>int</code> representing the character's level</li>
<li>A <code>boolean</code> representing whether the user chose to roll their hit points
(<code>true</code>) or take the average (<code>false</code>)</li>
<li>An <code>int</code> array containing the character's ability scores before ancestry
adjustments</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Must perform all calculations necessary to create the character sheet and then
print the character sheet. The parameters represent input provided by the user
in response to the program's initial prompts and the ability scores generated by
either the point buy or the dice roll method.</p>
