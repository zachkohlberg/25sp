<p>This website contains all of the projects for CSC110. Check Blackboard and the
syllabus if you have questions about which projects are required and how they
affect your grade.</p>
<p>I will add sections covering how to test and submit projects once I finish
updating the test program.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="project-background-character-sheet"><a class="header" href="#project-background-character-sheet">Project Background: Character Sheet</a></h1>
<p>Several projects involve writing a program to assist the user in creating a
character for a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG). This game will be similar to
Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition (D&amp;D 5e), but many of the rules will be
omitted or simplifed.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">Dungeons and Dragons</a> is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game">tabletop roleplaying game</a>.
Even if you haven't played a TTRPG before, you've probably heard the name
"Dungeons and Dragons" at some point. This assignment will use a modified
version of some character creation rules from D&amp;D 5e. The real rules can be
found in the <a href="https://www.5esrd.com/">5e System Reference Document</a> (SRD), which
you can read if you're curious and want to learn more. However, you do not need
to read the SRD for this assignment.</p>
<p>Below is a summary of some terms that will come up in this assignment:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>player</strong> is a real person playing the game, and their <strong>character</strong> or
<strong>player character</strong> (<strong>pc</strong> for short) is the fictional character they
control within the game.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>class</strong> is the role they fill in the game's world. In a game
like D&amp;D, which focuses on fighting fantasy monsters, a character's class
tells us their role in combat. A wizard casts spells, a rogue sneaks up on
enemies, and a fighter... fights. Yes, everyone fights, but the fighter fights
more directly, like with a sword and shield.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>ancestry</strong> or <strong>race</strong> (the term varies by game, but I'll
usually go with ancestry when not talking about a specific game) represents
what kind of creature they are. Standard D&amp;D races include elf, human, dwarf,
goblin, gnome, halfling, and orc. However, depending on the game and who's
running it, a TTRPG character could be anything: a ghost, a dragon, a talking
bear, or a mannequin. I have run a game of D&amp;D that included both a talking
bear and a mannequin. The mannequin also talked, not just the bear.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>HP</strong> or <strong>hit points</strong> represent how difficult they are to
defeat in combat.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>AC</strong> or <strong>armor class</strong> represents how hard they are to hit
with an attack. A high AC may mean that a character is very good at avoiding
attacks, or that a character is wearing armor that blocks most attacks.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>ability scores</strong> are numbers that represent a character's
strength, cunning, speed, and other qualities that affect most of their
actions in the game.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>ability modifiers</strong> are bonuses or penalties derived from
their ability scores. The modifiers are the numbers we actually use in most
calculations, and the scores only exist to determine the modifiers. At this
point, you may be wondering why we bother with ability scores if we don't use
them after calculating the modifiers. That's an excellent question!</li>
<li>A character's <strong>level</strong> represents how powerful and experienced they are. In
most RPGs, characters gain experience and level up to represent how they've
grown during their adventures.</li>
<li>In addition to standard six-sided dice (referred to as D6 dice), D&amp;D uses
several less common dice shapes: D4, D8, D10, D12, and D20.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="project-background-dice-game"><a class="header" href="#project-background-dice-game">Project Background: Dice Game</a></h1>
<p>Several projects involve writing a dice game similar to Yahtzee that can be
played on the terminal.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee">Yahtzee</a> is a dice game played with five
six-sided dice. The game has thirteen rounds, and in each round a player may
roll their dice up to three times. After the first roll, a player can choose to
only reroll some of their dice, leaving the others the same. Once a player is
finished rolling their dice, they choose one of the thirteen scoring categories
and receive points based on their dice. Each category can only be selected once.</p>
<p>Before you begin the dice game projects, read the Yahtzee rules and play a few
games so you understand how it works. The
<a href="https://instructions.hasbro.com/en-ca/instruction/yahtzee-classic">official rules</a>
are available from Hasbro, and the Wikipedia article also explains how to play.
Project directions will assume you already understand how to play Yahtzee and
how the scoring works.</p>

<p>Follow the steps below and write the program as directed. Test your code
frequently, <strong>at the bare minimum performing every test given in the steps.</strong></p>
<p>If your code is not working as expected, do not move on to the next step until
you have fixed it. Moving on without finishing a step correctly will make the
problem significantly harder to fix and likely add new problems as you continue
working. If you disregard this advice, then you may get to the end of the steps
and find it would actually be less work to start over from step 1 than to debug
the code you just finished writing.</p>
<ol>
<li>I recommend using comments to divide your program into sections so that it's
easier to stay organized. I'll be referring to three different parts of the
program in these steps: input, calculations, and output. Before the input
section, add comments with a title for the program and the author's name
(that's you). Feel free to copy the template below and fill in the missing
information.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">// Project 1: Character Sheet Part 1
// Author: your name here

void main() {
    ///////////
    // Input //
    ///////////

    // TODO: prompt for user input

    //////////////////
    // Calculations //
    //////////////////

    // TODO: calculations

    ////////////
    // Output //
    ////////////

    // TODO: print character sheet
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>In the input section, prompt the user for the following information in order:
their name, their character's name, their character's level, and their
character's ability scores (strength, dexterity, and constitution). Prompting
for input takes 1-2 lines of code and involves several steps:
<ul>
<li>Declare a new variable to hold the input value. Give the variable a
meaningful and descriptive name.</li>
<li>Call <code>readln</code> and include a prompt telling the user what information you
expect them to type. You can word the prompt however you want; the test
program will ignore your prompts when checking your program's output.</li>
<li>If you need your input as a number, remember to call <code>Integer.parseInt</code> or
<code>Double.parseDouble</code> <em>before</em> <code>readln</code>, and place the <code>readln</code> call inside
of the parenthesis after the parse function.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add some temporary print statements to the output section. Print the value of
each variable you read during the input section. This will help with early
testing. I recommend including the variable's name in its print statement:
<code>println("x = " + x);</code> instead of <code>println(x);</code>.</li>
<li>Test your program. You should see the first input prompt, and then the
program should pause until you enter your input before moving to the next
prompt. The program should repeat all of your input after you complete the
final prompt.</li>
<li>In the calculations section, calculate the character's HP (hit points), AC
(armor class), and attack bonus. Each of these properties should be a new
variable. Use the following formulas to calculate these properties:
<ul>
<li>The character's HP is equal to their level multiplied by their constitution
score.</li>
<li>The character's AC is equal to ten plus their dexterity score.</li>
<li>The character's attack bonus is equal to their level plus their strength
score.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add print statements for the new variables and test your program again. Pay
attention to the values printed for the hp, ac, and attack bonus variables,
and check the calculations yourself to confirm these are correct. If
everything looks right, then this is a good time to delete or comment out the
test print statements. We'll to write the actual output section next, so we
shouldn't need the test output anymore.</li>
<li>Print all of the information shown in the I/O Format section. Pay careful
attention to spelling, capitalization, and the order in which this output
appears. In order to pass the tests, it will have to match exactly with the
expected output.</li>
<li>Before you run my test program, try running your program yourself and make
sure the output looks correct. It will be nice to see the whole program
working, and it'll be faster to fix any obvious mistakes on your own than
using the test program.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="task-2-run-tests"><a class="header" href="#task-2-run-tests">Task 2: Run Tests</a></h3>
<p>Run the tests for your project and look at the feedback. If your code passed
every test, then this project is finished. The test program can also pack all of
your projects for upload to Blackboard.</p>
<h2 id="deliverables"><a class="header" href="#deliverables">Deliverables</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Your <code>CharacterSheet1.java</code> file</li>
</ul>
<p>In order for this project to count as complete, it must:</p>
<ul>
<li>be submitted on Blackboard before the deadline</li>
<li>be packaged and named correctly (use the test program's pack command)</li>
<li>pass all of the tests I gave you</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be easy to tell whether your project is complete as long as you run
the tests. If it's not passing and you can't figure out why, then ask for help
rather than submitting an incomplete assignment.</p>
<h2 id="additional-details"><a class="header" href="#additional-details">Additional Details</a></h2>
<h3 id="io-format"><a class="header" href="#io-format">I/O Format</a></h3>
<p>This program must meet the following I/O requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The program accepts the required input in the order shown in the assignment
and does not expect any additional input.</li>
<li>The program produces each line of required output in the order specified in
the assignment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The program may include additional output before, between, and after lines of
required output. This additional output must be on a separate line from any
required output.</p>
<p>Your program must accept the following user input:</p>
<ul>
<li>The player's name (String)</li>
<li>The character's name (String)</li>
<li>The character's level (int)</li>
<li>The character's strength score (int)</li>
<li>The character's dexterity score (int)</li>
<li>The character's constitution score (int)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your program must print the following output:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Player: &lt;NAME&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Character: &lt;NAME&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Level: &lt;LEVEL&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>HP: &lt;HP&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>AC: &lt;AC&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Attack: +&lt;ATTACK BONUS&gt;</code> (note the <code>+</code> before the attack bonus)</li>
<li><code>Str &lt;STRENGTH SCORE&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Dex &lt;DEXTERITY SCORE&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Con &lt;CONSTITUTION SCORE&gt;</code></li>

<li>
<p>This program requires two additional pieces of input. Prompt the player for
their character's ancestry and class after the character name and before the
level. Note that <code>class</code> is a
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/_keywords.html">reserved word</a>
in Java, which means you won't be able to use it as a variable name. A common
substitute is "clazz", although "characterClass" and "charClass" also make
good names for this variable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the user enters invalid input, then our program must print an error
message and exit. You should modify your prompts to tell the user what input
is allowed for the ancestry, class, level, and ability scores. This will also
be a helpful reminder when you test the program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can check whether the user's input is valid or invalid with an <code>if</code>
statement. You should check each input value immediately after the prompt to
avoid wasting extra time after receiving invalid input. Here are some hints
to get you started validating the level:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>valid</em> level is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive).</li>
<li>Our if statement should trigger on an <em>invalid</em> level, so we want to ask
whether it is outside this range. An invalid level is <strong>either</strong> less than
1 <strong>or</strong> greater than 20.</li>
<li>There are two parts to our condition, so we need to join them with an AND
(<code>&amp;&amp;</code>) or an OR (<code>||</code>). In this case, only one condition needs to be true
for the level to fall outside of the valid range, so we should use OR.</li>
<li>In the body of our if statement, we need to print an error message and exit
our program. The exact error message is <code>ERROR: INVALID INPUT</code>, and we can
skip the rest of our <code>main</code> function with an empty <code>return</code> statement. All
together, it looks like this:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">// prompt for input
int variableName = Integer.parseInt(readln("level prompt message"));

// check for invalid input
if (/*TODO: condition*/) {
    println("ERROR: INVALID INPUT");
    // exit main function early
    return;
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>You can use a similar prompt to check each ability score, which must be an
integer between 8 and 15 inclusive. After you add the error-checking for the
level and abilities, you should test each of them a few times. Try values
both inside and outside the range, and make sure the program exits with the
error message if and only if you enter a value outside the range. In
particular, you should check the boundaries of the range. One of the most
common mistakes in this type of code is to make a range inclusive when it
should have been exclusive, or to make it exclusive when it should have been
inclusive. If you make that mistake, then your code will work correctly for
all but one or two numbers. You should check 0, 1, 20, and 21 for the level,
as well as 7, 8, 15, and 16 for the ability scores.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once your error-checking code works for the numbers, you also need to check
the ancestry and class. Each of these have three options, and the user's
input is invalid if it is not equal to one of these options. This means we
have three parts to our condition, and they must be joined with AND or OR.
Which is appropriate? Let's try describing invalid input more closely to how
we would code it (checking each possibility separately) and see whether AND
or OR is more natural: an invalid ancestry is <strong>not</strong> an elf <strong>and</strong> it is
<strong>not</strong> a dwarf <strong>and</strong> it is <strong>not</strong> a human. Therefore we should use AND
(<code>&amp;&amp;</code>).</p>
<p>However, this can be tricky. There's another way to phrase our condition that
sounds natural and uses OR instead of AND: "an invalid ancestry is not an elf
<strong>or</strong> a dwarf <strong>or</strong> a human". Does this mean it doesn't matter whether we
use AND or OR? The trick with this phrase is how it looks when structured
like code: "it is <strong>not</strong> true that (an invalid ancestry is an elf <strong>or</strong> it
is a dwarf <strong>or</strong> it is a human)." We are using <strong>or</strong> to join several
equality checks (instead of inequality checks), then applying the NOT (<code>!</code>)
to the entire expression, which I've indicated by wrapping most of the
expression in parenthesis.</p>
<p>You'll develop an intuition for boolean logic with practice, so don't worry
if you had a hard time with this part. I'll summarize everything you need to
know for the AND solution to this error check:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check whether the ancestry/class is NOT equal to each option.</li>
<li>Join each of these comparisons with AND (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>).</li>
<li>Never compare strings with <code>s1 == s2</code> or <code>s1 != s2</code>. This will not work as
you want it to. Instead, compare them using the <code>.equals</code> function:
<code>s1.equals(s2)</code> for equality and <code>!s1.equals(s2)</code> for inequality.</li>
<li>Valid ancestries are "elf", "human", and "dwarf".</li>
<li>Valid classes are "fighter", "rogue", and "ranger".</li>
<li>Use the lowercase versions of these names. I will only use lowercase input
for these traits when testing your code, so you can assume that all input
is lowercase.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to test your new error-checking code. You should now get an error
message if you don't enter a valid ancestry or class, but the program should
still work if you enter valid input for everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now we need to update the calculations. We can break this into three phases:
adjust ability scores, calculate ability modifiers, and calculate other
values. We'll start with adjusting the ability scores. Each ancestry changes
one or more ability scores. Humans increase all of their scores by 1, elves
increase their dexterity by 2, and dwarves increase their constitution by 2.
You can structure this part as an else-if chain:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">if (variableName.equals("ancestry1")) {
    // TODO: adjust ability scores for ancestry 1
} else if (variableName.equals("ancestry2")) {
    // TODO: adjust ability scores for ancestry 2
} else {
    // NOTE: we've already checked for invalid input, so the only remaining
    // option is the third ancestry. This is why we can just use an else and
    // skip the variableName.equals("ancestry3") condition.
    // TODO: adjust ability scores for ancestry 3
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p>After you adjust ability scores for the character's ancestry, you need to
calculate each ability's modifier. This is a separate number from the score,
and it's used in most calculations that care about the ability instead of the
raw score. The <a href="./background/character_sheet.html">Character Sheet Background</a>
section explains the difference between ability scores and modifiers in more
detail.</p>
<p>The SRD has a table showing the modifier for each ability score. However, we
can more easily calculate this with a short formula:
<code>abilityModifier = (abilityScore / 2) - 5</code>. The parenthesis aren't necessary,
but they emphasize the order of operations. Dividing after subtraction
(<code>(abilityScore - 10) / 2</code>) would not give us the correct modifier for some
scores below ten.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="project2.html#calculations">Calculations</a> section covers the remaining calculations
you need to perform. You can find the relevant formulas and other information
there. Some of these calculations change depending on the class, so you
should use an else-if chain similar to what you wrote for the ancestry
adjustments. However, make sure you declare any variables <em>before</em> the start
of the if-else chain. If you declare a variable inside an if or else body,
then that variable will only exist inside that code block, and it won't be
available later when you perform other calculations or print your output.
Here's an outline to get started:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">// Declare all new variables here
int hp = 0;
// TODO: other variables

if (variableName.equals("class1")) {
    hp = /*TODO: class 1 hp calculations*/;
    // TODO: other class 1 calculations
} else if (variableName.equals("class2")) {
    // TODO: class 2 calculations
} else {
    // TODO: class 3 calculations
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="9">
<li>Test your code. We haven't updated the output yet, but you can run the
program and check the value of each variable from the calculations section to
make sure it's what you were expecting.</li>
<li>Finally, you can adjust the output to follow the <a href="project2.html#io-format">new format</a>
for Project 2 and show all of the new information you've calculated. Two of
the formatting requirements can be tricky to figure out: adding a plus to
any nonnegative modifiers and right-aligning the ability scores. You can use
if statements to handle this, but the <code>String.format</code> function solves this
problem much more easily than an if statement. The formatting specifiers
you'll need are <code>%2d</code> to right-align an ability score and <code>%+d</code> to force a
plus or minus sign in front of an ability modifier.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="task-2-run-tests-1"><a class="header" href="#task-2-run-tests-1">Task 2: Run Tests</a></h3>
<p>Run the tests for your project and look at the feedback. If your code passed
every test, then this project is finished. The test program can also pack all of
your projects for upload to Blackboard.</p>
<h2 id="deliverables-1"><a class="header" href="#deliverables-1">Deliverables</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Your <code>CharacterSheet2.java</code> file</li>
</ul>
<p>In order for this project to count as complete, it must:</p>
<ul>
<li>be submitted on Blackboard before the deadline</li>
<li>be packaged and named correctly (use the test program's pack command)</li>
<li>pass all of the tests I gave you</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be easy to tell whether your project is complete as long as you run

rather than submitting an incomplete assignment.</p>
<h2 id="additional-details-1"><a class="header" href="#additional-details-1">Additional Details</a></h2>
<h3 id="io-format-1"><a class="header" href="#io-format-1">I/O Format</a></h3>
<p>This program must meet the following I/O requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The program accepts the required input in the order shown in the assignment
and does not expect any additional input.</li>
<li>The program produces each line of required output in the order specified in
the assignment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The program may include additional output before, between, and after lines of
required output. This additional output must be on a separate line from any
required output.</p>
<p>Your program must accept the following user input:</p>
<ul>
<li>The player's name (String)</li>
<li>The character's name (String)</li>
<li>The character's ancestry (String)</li>
<li>The character's class (String)</li>
<li>The character's level (int)</li>
<li>The character's ability scores
<ul>
<li>Strength (int)</li>
<li>Dexterity (int)</li>
<li>Constitution (int)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If all user input is valid, then your program must print the following output:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Player: &lt;NAME&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Character: &lt;NAME&gt;, level &lt;LEVEL&gt; &lt;ANCESTRY&gt; &lt;CLASS&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>HP: &lt;HP&gt;, AC: &lt;AC&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Ability Scores:</code></li>
<li><code>Str &lt;STRENGTH SCORE&gt; &lt;STRENGTH MODIFIER&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Dex &lt;DEXTERITY SCORE&gt; &lt;DEXTERITY MODIFIER&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Con &lt;CONSTITUTION SCORE&gt; &lt;CONSTITUTION MODIFIER&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Attacks:</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;ATTACK1 NAME&gt; &lt;ATTACK1 MODIFIER&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;ATTACK2 NAME&gt; &lt;ATTACK2 MODIFIER&gt;</code> (note: some characters only have one
attack)</li>
</ul>
<p>Two additional requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a score (strength, dexterity, and constitution) is a single-digit number,
then it must be padded with an extra space so that all scores are
right-aligned in their column.</li>
<li>Each modifier (strength, dexterity, constitution, and attack) must be preceded
by a plus or minus sign. Negative modifiers have a minus sign, and nonnegative
(which includes zero) modifiers have a plus sign. This reinforces how these
numbers are meant to be used: they are usually added to dice rolls and other
values rather than used on their own.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ability scores and attacks should also be indented for readability, but
indentation will not be checked by the tests.</p>
<p>Here is an example of possible user input and the resulting character sheet:</p>
<p>Input:</p>
<pre><code>Alice
Bob
elf
ranger
4
15
14
9
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Player: Alice
Character: Bob, level 4 elf ranger
HP: 28, AC: 17
Ability Scores:
    Str 15 (+2)
    Dex 16 (+3)
    Con  9 (-1)
Attacks:
    Longsword +4
    Longbow +5
</code></pre>
<h3 id="valid-input"><a class="header" href="#valid-input">Valid Input</a></h3>
<p>There are two ways for the user to enter invalid input:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user can enter a string or double when you were expecting an integer. If
the user entered the word "nine" or the number 12.4 when asked for their
level, then this would be the wrong <em>type</em> of input.</li>
<li>The user can enter the correct <em>type</em> of input, but not one of the values
they were allowed to enter. If the user entered -2 or 50 when asked for their
level, then this would be the correct type of input (an integer), but not one
of the integers they were allowed to choose for their level (a number from 1
to 20).</li>
</ol>
<p>The first kind of error is more complicated to deal with, and you won't learn
how to handle those errors until later in the semester. You only need to worry
about the second kind of error in this assignment. You can assume that the user
will always enter the correct type of value, but your code must check whether it
was one of the values they were allowed to choose. If the user enters an invalid
value of the correct type, then your program must print the message
<code>ERROR: INVALID INPUT</code> and exit.</p>
<p>Here are all of the rules you must enforce when checking the user's input:</p>
<ul>
<li>The level must be an integer from 1 to 20.</li>
<li>Each ability score must be an integer from 8 to 15.</li>
<li>The ancestry must be either "human", "elf", or "dwarf".</li>
<li>The class must be either "fighter", "ranger", or "rogue".</li>
</ul>
<p>You can assume that the user's input for class and ancestry are always
lowercase. Your code <em>must</em> correctly handle the lowercase versions of these
strings, but it doesn't matter what you do when given other capitalizations
(such as "Human", "RANGER", or "DwARf"). The ancestry and class must also appear
as all lowercase in the program's <em>output</em>.</p>
<h3 id="calculations"><a class="header" href="#calculations">Calculations</a></h3>
<p>This program involves more calculations and variables than the previous program.
This section will serve as a reference for all values that are calculated by the
program.</p>
<ol>
<li>Before any other calculations, some of the ability <strong>scores</strong> must be
adjusted by the player's ancestry:
<ul>
<li>If the character is a human, increase each ability score by one.</li>
<li>If the character is an elf, increase their dexterity score by two.</li>
<li>If the character is a dwarf, increase their constitution score by two.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each ability score has an associated number called its
<a href="https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores">modifier</a>. The modifier <em>does
not alter the score</em>, it is derived <em>from</em> the score. The srd link has a
table showing the modifier associated with each score from 1 to 30, but we
can calculate the modifier with a formula.
<ul>
<li>Each ability modifier is calculated by dividing the score by 2 and
subtracting 5. The formula should look like this:
<code>modifier = score / 2 - 5</code>.</li>
<li>It's important that you divide <em>before</em> subtracting because integer
division will round towards zero, not down. We could perform a similar
calculation by subtracting 10 and then dividing by 2, but this would give
the wrong value for odd ability scores below 10. For example, a score of 9
would produce a modifier of 0 when it should have a modifier of -1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The character's HP equals their level multiplied by the sum of their
constitution modifier and their "hit die". The hit die is determined by the
character's class. A fighter has a hit die of 10, and the other two classes
have a hit die of 8. The formula should look like this:
<code>hp = level * (conModifier + hitDie)</code>.</li>
<li>The character's AC (armor class) uses a different formula depending on their
class:
<ul>
<li>A fighter's AC is equal to 18</li>
<li>A ranger's AC is equal to 15 plus their dexterity modifier, but their AC
cannot be higher than 17</li>
<li>A rogue's AC is equal to 12 plus their dexterity modifier</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The character's proficiency is not displayed, but it is used to determine
their attack bonus. You can calculate proficiency with the formula
<code>proficiency = 1 + (level + 3) / 4</code>.</li>
<li>Depending on their class, the character has one or two attacks. Each attack
has a name and a bonus. The bonus is equal to the character's proficiency
bonus plus one of their ability modifiers.
<ul>
<li>A fighter has one attack called <code>Greatsword</code>, which uses their strength
modifier</li>
<li>A rogue has two attacks: <code>Dagger</code> and <code>Crossbow</code>, which both use their
dexterity modifier</li>
<li>A ranger has two attacks: <code>Longsword</code>, which uses their strength modifier,
and <code>Longbow</code>, which uses their dexterity modifier</li>
</ul>
</li>
