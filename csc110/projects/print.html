<p>This website contains all of the projects for CSC110. Check Blackboard and the

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="project-background-character-sheet"><a class="header" href="#project-background-character-sheet">Project Background: Character Sheet</a></h1>
<p>Several projects involve writing a program to assist the user in creating a
character for a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG). This game will be similar to
Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition (D&amp;D 5e), but many of the rules will be
omitted or simplifed.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">Dungeons and Dragons</a> is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game">tabletop roleplaying game</a>.
Even if you haven't played a TTRPG before, you've probably heard the name
"Dungeons and Dragons" at some point. This assignment will use a modified
version of some character creation rules from D&amp;D 5e. The real rules can be
found in the <a href="https://www.5esrd.com/">5e System Reference Document</a> (SRD), which
you can read if you're curious and want to learn more. However, you do not need
to read the SRD for this assignment.</p>
<p>Below is a summary of some terms that will come up in this assignment:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>player</strong> is a real person playing the game, and their <strong>character</strong> or
<strong>player character</strong> (<strong>pc</strong> for short) is the fictional character they
control within the game.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>class</strong> is the role they fill in the game's world. In a game
like D&amp;D, which focuses on fighting fantasy monsters, a character's class
tells us their role in combat. A wizard casts spells, a rogue sneaks up on
enemies, and a fighter... fights. Yes, everyone fights, but the fighter fights
more directly, like with a sword and shield.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>ancestry</strong> or <strong>race</strong> (the term varies by game, but I'll
usually go with ancestry when not talking about a specific game) represents
what kind of creature they are. Standard D&amp;D races include elf, human, dwarf,
goblin, gnome, halfling, and orc. However, depending on the game and who's
running it, a TTRPG character could be anything: a ghost, a dragon, a talking
bear, or a mannequin. I have run a game of D&amp;D that included both a talking
bear and a mannequin. The mannequin also talked, not just the bear.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>HP</strong> or <strong>hit points</strong> represent how difficult they are to
defeat in combat.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>AC</strong> or <strong>armor class</strong> represents how hard they are to hit
with an attack. A high AC may mean that a character is very good at avoiding
attacks, or that a character is wearing armor that blocks most attacks.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>ability scores</strong> are numbers that represent a character's
strength, cunning, speed, and other qualities that affect most of their
actions in the game.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>ability modifiers</strong> are bonuses or penalties derived from
their ability scores. The modifiers are the numbers we actually use in most
calculations, and the scores only exist to determine the modifiers. At this
point, you may be wondering why we bother with ability scores if we don't use
them after calculating the modifiers. That's an excellent question!</li>
<li>A character's <strong>level</strong> represents how powerful and experienced they are. In
most RPGs, characters gain experience and level up to represent how they've
grown during their adventures.</li>
<li>In addition to standard six-sided dice (referred to as D6 dice), D&amp;D uses
several less common dice shapes: D4, D8, D10, D12, and D20.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="project-background-dice-game"><a class="header" href="#project-background-dice-game">Project Background: Dice Game</a></h1>
<p>Several projects involve writing a dice game similar to Yahtzee that can be
played on the terminal.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee">Yahtzee</a> is a dice game played with five
six-sided dice. The game has thirteen rounds, and in each round a player may
roll their dice up to three times. After the first roll, a player can choose to
only reroll some of their dice, leaving the others the same. Once a player is
finished rolling their dice, they choose one of the thirteen scoring categories
and receive points based on their dice. Each category can only be selected once.</p>
<p>Before you begin the dice game projects, read the Yahtzee rules and play a few
games so you understand how it works. The
<a href="https://instructions.hasbro.com/en-ca/instruction/yahtzee-classic">official rules</a>
are available from Hasbro, and the Wikipedia article also explains how to play.
Project directions will assume you already understand how to play Yahtzee and
how the scoring works.</p>

<p>This program will prompt the user for a few pieces of information about their
character, calculate some additional stats, and then print a character sheet.</p>

<h2 id="tasks"><a class="header" href="#tasks">Tasks</a></h2>
<h3 id="task-1-guided-coding"><a class="header" href="#task-1-guided-coding">Task 1: Guided Coding</a></h3>
<p>Follow the steps below and write the program as directed. Test your code
frequently, <strong>at the bare minimum performing every test given in the steps.</strong></p>
<p>If your code is not working as expected, do not move on to the next step until
you have fixed it. Moving on without finishing a step correctly will make the
problem significantly harder to fix and likely add new problems as you continue
working. If you disregard this advice, then you may get to the end of the steps
and find it would actually be less work to start over from step 1 than to debug
the code you just finished writing.</p>
<ol>
<li>I recommend using comments to divide your program into sections so that it's
easier to stay organized. I'll be referring to three different parts of the
program in these steps: input, calculations, and output. Before the input
section, add comments with a title for the program and the author's name
(that's you). Feel free to copy the template below and fill in the missing
information.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">// Project 1: Character Sheet Part 1
// Author: your name here

void main() {
    ///////////
    // Input //
    ///////////

    // TODO: prompt for user input

    //////////////////
    // Calculations //
    //////////////////

    // TODO: calculations

    ////////////
    // Output //
    ////////////

    // TODO: print character sheet
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>In the input section, prompt the user for the following information in order:
their name, their character's name, their character's level, and their
character's ability scores (strength, dexterity, and constitution). Prompting
for input takes 1-2 lines of code and involves several steps:
<ul>
<li>Declare a new variable to hold the input value. Give the variable a
meaningful and descriptive name.</li>
<li>Call <code>readln</code> and include a prompt telling the user what information you
expect them to type. You can word the prompt however you want; the test
program will ignore your prompts when checking your program's output.</li>
<li>If you need your input as a number, remember to call <code>Integer.parseInt</code> or
<code>Double.parseDouble</code> <em>before</em> <code>readln</code>, and place the <code>readln</code> call inside
of the parenthesis after the parse function.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add some temporary print statements to the output section. Print the value of
each variable you read during the input section. This will help with early
testing. I recommend including the variable's name in its print statement:
<code>println("x = " + x);</code> instead of <code>println(x);</code>.</li>
<li>Test your program. You should see the first input prompt, and then the
program should pause until you enter your input before moving to the next
prompt. The program should repeat all of your input after you complete the
final prompt.</li>
<li>In the calculations section, calculate the character's HP (hit points), AC
(armor class), and attack bonus. Each of these properties should be a new
variable. Use the following formulas to calculate these properties:
<ul>
<li>The character's HP is equal to their level multiplied by their constitution
score.</li>
<li>The character's AC is equal to ten plus their dexterity score.</li>
<li>The character's attack bonus is equal to their level plus their strength
score.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add print statements for the new variables and test your program again. Pay
attention to the values printed for the hp, ac, and attack bonus variables,
and check the calculations yourself to confirm these are correct. If
everything looks right, then this is a good time to delete or comment out the
test print statements. We'll to write the actual output section next, so we
shouldn't need the test output anymore.</li>
<li>Print all of the information shown in the I/O Format section. Pay careful
attention to spelling, capitalization, and the order in which this output
appears. In order to pass the tests, it will have to match exactly with the
expected output.</li>
<li>Before you run my test program, try running your program yourself and make
sure the output looks correct. It will be nice to see the whole program
working, and it'll be faster to fix any obvious mistakes on your own than
using the test program.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="task-2-run-tests"><a class="header" href="#task-2-run-tests">Task 2: Run Tests</a></h3>
<p>Before using my tests, run the program yourself and make sure it works as
expected. You'll be able to catch obvious bugs more quickly this way, and if
your program doesn't ever run, then my test program won't be very helpful.</p>
<p>If your program appears to work, then run the tests for your project and look at
the feedback. If your code passed every test, then this project is finished. If
not, then use the test feedback and the requirements under
<a href="project1.html#additional-details">Additional Details</a> to fix these errors and retest until
you've passed every test.</p>
<p>This project must be written as a "simple source file", which is still a preview
feature as of Java 24 and requires you to run the program with the
<code>--enable-preview</code> flag. If you've been following along in the lecture, then
this is how you've been writing Java programs and doesn't require you to do
anything differently.</p>
<p>If you've been ignoring the lectures and relying on other sources or previous
experience, then you're probably not familiar with simple source files. In that
case, you should go review the lecture material and make sure you understand how
we've learned to structure Java programs and perform input and output.</p>
<p>The tests that your program must pass require that your code is a simple source
file and that it uses the <code>print</code>, <code>println</code>, and <code>readln</code> functions for input
and output (not a scanner, console, or <code>System.out.println</code>). It also requires
that your code is not placed inside of a class definition and that you use the
simplified <code>void main() {...}</code> function instead of
<code>public static void main(String[] args) {...}</code>. If you ignore these
requirements, then your code will not pass the tests (which means it's
incomplete), and you may not see a helpful error message when it fails the
tests.</p>
<h2 id="deliverables"><a class="header" href="#deliverables">Deliverables</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Your <code>CharacterSheet1.java</code> file</li>
</ul>
<p>In order for this project to count as complete, it must:</p>
<ul>
<li>be submitted on Blackboard before the deadline</li>
<li>be zipped and named correctly (use the test program's zip command)</li>
<li>pass all of the tests I gave you</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be easy to tell whether your project is complete as long as you run
the tests. If it's not passing and you can't figure out why, then ask for help
rather than submitting an incomplete assignment. Submissions that fail any test
cases will be marked incomplete.</p>
<h2 id="additional-details"><a class="header" href="#additional-details">Additional Details</a></h2>
<h3 id="io-format"><a class="header" href="#io-format">I/O Format</a></h3>
<p>This program must meet the following I/O requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The program accepts the required input in the order shown in the assignment
and does not expect any additional input.</li>
<li>The program produces each line of required output in the order specified in
the assignment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The program may include additional output before, between, and after lines of
required output. This additional output must be on a separate line from any
required output.</p>
<p>Your program must accept the following user input:</p>
<ul>
<li>The player's name (String)</li>
<li>The character's name (String)</li>
<li>The character's level (int)</li>
<li>The character's strength score (int)</li>
<li>The character's dexterity score (int)</li>
<li>The character's constitution score (int)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your program must print the following output:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Player: &lt;NAME&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Character: &lt;NAME&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Level: &lt;LEVEL&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>HP: &lt;HP&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>AC: &lt;AC&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Attack: +&lt;ATTACK BONUS&gt;</code> (note the <code>+</code> before the attack bonus)</li>
<li><code>Str &lt;STRENGTH SCORE&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Dex &lt;DEXTERITY SCORE&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Con &lt;CONSTITUTION SCORE&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example of possible user input and the resulting character sheet:</p>
<p>Input:</p>
<pre><code>Alice
Bob
10
18
13
15
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Player: Alice
Character: Bob
Level: 10
HP: 150
AC: 23
Attack: +28

<p>Follow the steps below and write the program as directed. Test your code
frequently, <strong>at the bare minimum performing every test given in the steps.</strong></p>
<p>If your code is not working as expected, do not move on to the next step until
you have fixed it. Moving on without finishing a step correctly will make the
problem significantly harder to fix and likely add new problems as you continue
working. If you disregard this advice, then you may get to the end of the steps
and find it would actually be less work to start over from step 1 than to debug
the code you just finished writing.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This program requires two additional pieces of input. Prompt the player for
their character's ancestry and class after the character name and before the
level. Note that <code>class</code> is a
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/_keywords.html">reserved word</a>
in Java, which means you won't be able to use it as a variable name. A common
substitute is "clazz", although "characterClass" and "charClass" also make
good names for this variable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the user enters invalid input, then our program must print an error
message and exit. You should modify your prompts to tell the user what input
is allowed for the ancestry, class, level, and ability scores. This will also
be a helpful reminder when you test the program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can check whether the user's input is valid or invalid with an <code>if</code>
statement. You should check each input value immediately after the prompt to
avoid wasting extra time after receiving invalid input. Here are some hints
to get you started validating the level:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>valid</em> level is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive).</li>
<li>Our if statement should trigger on an <em>invalid</em> level, so we want to ask
whether it is outside this range. An invalid level is <strong>either</strong> less than
1 <strong>or</strong> greater than 20.</li>
<li>There are two parts to our condition, so we need to join them with an AND
(<code>&amp;&amp;</code>) or an OR (<code>||</code>). In this case, only one condition needs to be true
for the level to fall outside of the valid range, so we should use OR.</li>
<li>In the body of our if statement, we need to print an error message and exit
our program. The exact error message is <code>ERROR: INVALID INPUT</code>, and we can
skip the rest of our <code>main</code> function with an empty <code>return</code> statement. All
together, it looks like this:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">// prompt for input
int variableName = Integer.parseInt(readln("level prompt message"));

// check for invalid input
if (/*TODO: condition*/) {
    println("ERROR: INVALID INPUT");
    // exit main function early
    return;
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>You can use a similar prompt to check each ability score, which must be an
integer between 8 and 15 inclusive. After you add the error-checking for the
level and abilities, you should test each of them a few times. Try values
both inside and outside the range, and make sure the program exits with the
error message if and only if you enter a value outside the range. In
particular, you should check the boundaries of the range. One of the most
common mistakes in this type of code is to make a range inclusive when it
should have been exclusive, or to make it exclusive when it should have been
inclusive. If you make that mistake, then your code will work correctly for
all but one or two numbers. You should check 0, 1, 20, and 21 for the level,
as well as 7, 8, 15, and 16 for the ability scores.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once your error-checking code works for the numbers, you also need to check
the ancestry and class. Each of these have three options, and the user's
input is invalid if it is not equal to one of these options. This means we
have three parts to our condition, and they must be joined with AND or OR.
Which is appropriate? Let's try describing invalid input more closely to how
we would code it (checking each possibility separately) and see whether AND
or OR is more natural: an invalid ancestry is <strong>not</strong> an elf <strong>and</strong> it is
<strong>not</strong> a dwarf <strong>and</strong> it is <strong>not</strong> a human. Therefore we should use AND
(<code>&amp;&amp;</code>).</p>
<p>However, this can be tricky. There's another way to phrase our condition that
sounds natural and uses OR instead of AND: "an invalid ancestry is not an elf
<strong>or</strong> a dwarf <strong>or</strong> a human". Does this mean it doesn't matter whether we
use AND or OR? The trick with this phrase is how it looks when structured
like code: "it is <strong>not</strong> true that (an invalid ancestry is an elf <strong>or</strong> it
is a dwarf <strong>or</strong> it is a human)." We are using <strong>or</strong> to join several
equality checks (instead of inequality checks), then applying the NOT (<code>!</code>)
to the entire expression, which I've indicated by wrapping most of the
expression in parenthesis.</p>
<p>You'll develop an intuition for boolean logic with practice, so don't worry
if you had a hard time with this part. I'll summarize everything you need to
know for the AND solution to this error check:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check whether the ancestry/class is NOT equal to each option.</li>
<li>Join each of these comparisons with AND (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>).</li>
<li>Never compare strings with <code>s1 == s2</code> or <code>s1 != s2</code>. This will not work as
you want it to. Instead, compare them using the <code>.equals</code> function:
<code>s1.equals(s2)</code> for equality and <code>!s1.equals(s2)</code> for inequality.</li>
<li>Valid ancestries are "elf", "human", and "dwarf".</li>
<li>Valid classes are "fighter", "rogue", and "ranger".</li>
<li>Use the lowercase versions of these names. I will only use lowercase input
for these traits when testing your code, so you can assume that all input
is lowercase.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to test your new error-checking code. You should now get an error
message if you don't enter a valid ancestry or class, but the program should
still work if you enter valid input for everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now we need to update the calculations. We can break this into three phases:
adjust ability scores, calculate ability modifiers, and calculate other
values. We'll start with adjusting the ability scores. Each ancestry changes
one or more ability scores. Humans increase all of their scores by 1, elves
increase their dexterity by 2, and dwarves increase their constitution by 2.
You can structure this part as an else-if chain:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">if (variableName.equals("ancestry1")) {
    // TODO: adjust ability scores for ancestry 1
} else if (variableName.equals("ancestry2")) {
    // TODO: adjust ability scores for ancestry 2
} else {
    // NOTE: we've already checked for invalid input, so the only remaining
    // option is the third ancestry. This is why we can just use an else and
    // skip the variableName.equals("ancestry3") condition.
    // TODO: adjust ability scores for ancestry 3
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p>After you adjust ability scores for the character's ancestry, you need to
calculate each ability's modifier. This is a separate number from the score,
and it's used in most calculations that care about the ability instead of the
raw score. The <a href="./background/character_sheet.html">Character Sheet Background</a>
section explains the difference between ability scores and modifiers in more
detail.</p>
<p>The SRD has a table showing the modifier for each ability score. However, we
can more easily calculate this with a short formula:
<code>abilityModifier = (abilityScore / 2) - 5</code>. The parenthesis aren't necessary,
but they emphasize the order of operations. Dividing after subtraction
(<code>(abilityScore - 10) / 2</code>) would not give us the correct modifier for some
scores below ten.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="project2.html#calculations">Calculations</a> section covers the remaining calculations
you need to perform. You can find the relevant formulas and other information
there. Some of these calculations change depending on the class, so you
should use an else-if chain similar to what you wrote for the ancestry
adjustments. However, make sure you declare any variables <em>before</em> the start
of the if-else chain. If you declare a variable inside an if or else body,
then that variable will only exist inside that code block, and it won't be
available later when you perform other calculations or print your output.
Here's an outline to get started:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">// Declare all new variables here
int hp = 0;
// TODO: other variables

if (variableName.equals("class1")) {
    hp = /*TODO: class 1 hp calculations*/;
    // TODO: other class 1 calculations
} else if (variableName.equals("class2")) {
    // TODO: class 2 calculations
} else {
    // TODO: class 3 calculations
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="9">
<li>Test your code. We haven't updated the output yet, but you can run the
program and check the value of each variable from the calculations section to
make sure it's what you were expecting.</li>
<li>Finally, you can adjust the output to follow the <a href="project2.html#io-format">new format</a>
for Project 2 and show all of the new information you've calculated. Two of
the formatting requirements can be tricky to figure out: adding a plus to
any nonnegative modifiers and right-aligning the ability scores. You can use
if statements to handle this, but the <code>String.format</code> function solves this
problem much more easily than an if statement. The formatting specifiers
you'll need are <code>%2d</code> to right-align an ability score and <code>%+d</code> to force a
plus or minus sign in front of an ability modifier.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="task-2-run-tests-1"><a class="header" href="#task-2-run-tests-1">Task 2: Run Tests</a></h3>
<p>Before using my tests, run the program yourself and make sure it works as
expected. You'll be able to catch obvious bugs more quickly this way, and if
your program doesn't ever run, then my test program won't be very helpful.</p>
<p>If your program appears to work, then run the tests for your project and look at
the feedback. If your code passed every test, then this project is finished. If
not, then use the test feedback and the requirements under
<a href="project2.html#additional-details">Additional Details</a> to fix these errors and retest until
you've passed every test.</p>
<p>This project must be written as a "simple source file", which is still a preview
feature as of Java 24 and requires you to run the program with the
<code>--enable-preview</code> flag. If you've been following along in the lecture, then
this is how you've been writing Java programs and doesn't require you to do
anything differently.</p>
<p>If you've been ignoring the lectures and relying on other sources or previous
experience, then you're probably not familiar with simple source files. In that
case, you should go review the lecture material and make sure you understand how
we've learned to structure Java programs and perform input and output.</p>
<p>The tests that your program must pass require that your code is a simple source
file and that it uses the <code>print</code>, <code>println</code>, and <code>readln</code> functions for input
and output (not a scanner, console, or <code>System.out.println</code>). It also requires
that your code is not placed inside of a class definition and that you use the
simplified <code>void main() {...}</code> function instead of
<code>public static void main(String[] args) {...}</code>. If you ignore these
requirements, then your code will not pass the tests (which means it's
incomplete), and you may not see a helpful error message when it fails the
tests.</p>
<h2 id="deliverables-1"><a class="header" href="#deliverables-1">Deliverables</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Your <code>CharacterSheet2.java</code> file</li>
</ul>
<p>In order for this project to count as complete, it must:</p>
<ul>
<li>be submitted on Blackboard before the deadline</li>
<li>be zipped and named correctly (use the test program's zip command)</li>
<li>pass all of the tests I gave you</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be easy to tell whether your project is complete as long as you run
the tests. If it's not passing and you can't figure out why, then ask for help
rather than submitting an incomplete assignment. Submissions that fail any test
cases will be marked incomplete.</p>
<h2 id="additional-details-1"><a class="header" href="#additional-details-1">Additional Details</a></h2>
<h3 id="io-format-1"><a class="header" href="#io-format-1">I/O Format</a></h3>
<p>This program must meet the following I/O requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The program accepts the required input in the order shown in the assignment
and does not expect any additional input.</li>
<li>The program produces each line of required output in the order specified in
the assignment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The program may include additional output before, between, and after lines of
required output. This additional output must be on a separate line from any
required output.</p>
<p>Your program must accept the following user input:</p>
<ul>
<li>The player's name (String)</li>
<li>The character's name (String)</li>
<li>The character's ancestry (String)</li>
<li>The character's class (String)</li>
<li>The character's level (int)</li>
<li>The character's ability scores
<ul>
<li>Strength (int)</li>
<li>Dexterity (int)</li>
<li>Constitution (int)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If all user input is valid, then your program must print the following output:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Player: &lt;NAME&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Character: &lt;NAME&gt;, level &lt;LEVEL&gt; &lt;ANCESTRY&gt; &lt;CLASS&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>HP: &lt;HP&gt;, AC: &lt;AC&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Ability Scores:</code></li>
<li><code>Str &lt;STRENGTH SCORE&gt; &lt;STRENGTH MODIFIER&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Dex &lt;DEXTERITY SCORE&gt; &lt;DEXTERITY MODIFIER&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Con &lt;CONSTITUTION SCORE&gt; &lt;CONSTITUTION MODIFIER&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Attacks:</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;ATTACK1 NAME&gt; &lt;ATTACK1 MODIFIER&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;ATTACK2 NAME&gt; &lt;ATTACK2 MODIFIER&gt;</code> (note: some characters only have one
attack)</li>
</ul>
<p>Two additional requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a score (strength, dexterity, and constitution) is a single-digit number,
then it must be padded with an extra space so that all scores are
right-aligned in their column.</li>
<li>Each modifier (strength, dexterity, constitution, and attack) must be preceded
by a plus or minus sign. Negative modifiers have a minus sign, and nonnegative
(which includes zero) modifiers have a plus sign. This reinforces how these
numbers are meant to be used: they are usually added to dice rolls and other
values rather than used on their own.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ability scores and attacks should also be indented for readability, but
indentation will not be checked by the tests.</p>
<p>Here is an example of possible user input and the resulting character sheet:</p>
<p>Input:</p>
<pre><code>Alice
Bob
elf
ranger
4
15
14
9
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Player: Alice
Character: Bob, level 4 elf ranger
HP: 28, AC: 17
Ability Scores:
    Str 15 (+2)
    Dex 16 (+3)
    Con  9 (-1)
Attacks:
    Longsword +4
    Longbow +5
</code></pre>
<h3 id="valid-input"><a class="header" href="#valid-input">Valid Input</a></h3>
<p>There are two ways for the user to enter invalid input:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user can enter a string or double when you were expecting an integer. If
the user entered the word "nine" or the number 12.4 when asked for their
level, then this would be the wrong <em>type</em> of input.</li>
<li>The user can enter the correct <em>type</em> of input, but not one of the values
they were allowed to enter. If the user entered -2 or 50 when asked for their
level, then this would be the correct type of input (an integer), but not one
of the integers they were allowed to choose for their level (a number from 1
to 20).</li>
</ol>
<p>The first kind of error is more complicated to deal with, and you won't learn
how to handle those errors until later in the semester. You only need to worry
about the second kind of error in this assignment. You can assume that the user
will always enter the correct type of value, but your code must check whether it
was one of the values they were allowed to choose. If the user enters an invalid
value of the correct type, then your program must print the message
<code>ERROR: INVALID INPUT</code> and exit.</p>
<p>Here are all of the rules you must enforce when checking the user's input:</p>
<ul>
<li>The level must be an integer from 1 to 20.</li>
<li>Each ability score must be an integer from 8 to 15.</li>
<li>The ancestry must be either "human", "elf", or "dwarf".</li>
<li>The class must be either "fighter", "ranger", or "rogue".</li>
</ul>
<p>You can assume that the user's input for class and ancestry are always
lowercase. Your code <em>must</em> correctly handle the lowercase versions of these
strings, but it doesn't matter what you do when given other capitalizations
(such as "Human", "RANGER", or "DwARf"). The ancestry and class must also appear
as all lowercase in the program's <em>output</em>.</p>
<h3 id="calculations"><a class="header" href="#calculations">Calculations</a></h3>
<p>This program involves more calculations and variables than the previous program.
This section will serve as a reference for all values that are calculated by the
program.</p>
<ol>
<li>Before any other calculations, some of the ability <strong>scores</strong> must be
adjusted by the player's ancestry:
<ul>
<li>If the character is a human, increase each ability score by one.</li>
<li>If the character is an elf, increase their dexterity score by two.</li>
<li>If the character is a dwarf, increase their constitution score by two.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each ability score has an associated number called its
<a href="https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores">modifier</a>. The modifier <em>does
not alter the score</em>, it is derived <em>from</em> the score. The srd link has a
table showing the modifier associated with each score from 1 to 30, but we
can calculate the modifier with a formula.
<ul>
<li>Each ability modifier is calculated by dividing the score by 2 and
subtracting 5. The formula should look like this:
<code>modifier = score / 2 - 5</code>.</li>
<li>It's important that you divide <em>before</em> subtracting because integer
division will round towards zero, not down. We could perform a similar
calculation by subtracting 10 and then dividing by 2, but this would give
the wrong value for odd ability scores below 10. For example, a score of 9
would produce a modifier of 0 when it should have a modifier of -1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The character's HP equals their level multiplied by the sum of their
constitution modifier and their "hit die". The hit die is determined by the
character's class. A fighter has a hit die of 10, and the other two classes
have a hit die of 8. The formula should look like this:
<code>hp = level * (conModifier + hitDie)</code>.</li>
<li>The character's AC (armor class) uses a different formula depending on their
class:
<ul>
<li>A fighter's AC is equal to 18</li>
<li>A ranger's AC is equal to 15 plus their dexterity modifier, but their AC
cannot be higher than 17</li>
<li>A rogue's AC is equal to 12 plus their dexterity modifier</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The character's proficiency is not displayed, but it is used to determine
their attack bonus. You can calculate proficiency with the formula
<code>proficiency = 1 + (level + 3) / 4</code>.</li>
<li>Depending on their class, the character has one or two attacks. Each attack
has a name and a bonus. The bonus is equal to the character's proficiency
bonus plus one of their ability modifiers.
<ul>
<li>A fighter has one attack called <code>Greatsword</code>, which uses their strength
modifier</li>
<li>A rogue has two attacks: <code>Dagger</code> and <code>Crossbow</code>, which both use their
dexterity modifier</li>
<li>A ranger has two attacks: <code>Longsword</code>, which uses their strength modifier,
and <code>Longbow</code>, which uses their dexterity modifier</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Follow the steps below and write the program as directed. Test your code
frequently, <strong>at the bare minimum performing every test given in the steps.</strong></p>
<p>If your code is not working as expected, do not move on to the next step until
you have fixed it. Moving on without finishing a step correctly will make the
problem significantly harder to fix and likely add new problems as you continue
working. If you disregard this advice, then you may get to the end of the steps
and find it would actually be less work to start over from step 1 than to debug
the code you just finished writing.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This program is broken into several functions. We'll write each function
separately, test it in <code>main</code>, and then write the real <code>main</code> function once
we've finished all of our separate functions. Take a look at the
<a href="project3.html#sample-run">Sample Run</a> section to see what the program looks like when
running before you continue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our first function, <code>printDice</code>, will display the dice as shown in the sample
run. This involves two steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Print the labels above the dice, and remember to include two spaces between
each letter</li>
<li>Loop over the dice array and print each element followed by two spaces</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that we can process an array with a for loop like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">for (int i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++) {
    // here we would do something with array[i]
}
</code></pre>
<p>To test <code>printDice</code>, try calling it in your <code>main</code> function. You can
hard-code a couple of arrays and check whether the correct numbers appear in
your output. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">void main() {
    printDice(new int[] { 1, 2, 4, 2, 3 });
    printDice(new int[] { 6, 5, 5, 6, 5 });
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can remove this test code from <code>main</code> once you're confident that
<code>printDice</code> produces the correct output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next we'll write the <code>rollAllDice</code> function. This function should set each
element of an <code>int</code> array equal to a random number from 1 to 6. You already
have two methods you can call from the <code>Dice</code> class to generate these numbers
(<code>Dice.roll(6)</code> and <code>Dice.d6()</code>), and the previous step covered iterating
over an array.</p>
<p>To test this function, you'll want to print an array before and after calling
<code>rollAllDice</code>. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">void main() {
    int[] array = new int[5];
    printDice(array);
    rollAllDice(array);
    printDice(array);
}
</code></pre>
<p>We should see zeroes when we first print the array (elements of a
newly-created <code>int</code> array default to zero), and we should see different
numbers from one to six the second time we print the array. Running the
program multiple times should produce different results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>rollSomeDice</code> function is similar to the <code>rollAllDice</code> function, but we
need to choose which dice to roll based on the <code>String</code> parameter. See the
<a href="project3.html#rollsomedice"><code>rollSomeDice</code></a> section for details.</p>
<p>You can copy your <code>rollAllDice</code> function to get started, but don't forget to
add the second parameter. You also need to add an <code>if</code> statement inside the
loop to decide whether to reroll the die at that index.</p>
<p>There are a few ways you could check whether a die needs to be rerolled. One
approach you can try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convert the index to a letter by adding it to <code>'a'</code> and converting the
result back to a <code>char</code>. For example, <code>(char)('a' + 2)</code> would give you the
letter <code>'c'</code>.</li>
<li>Use the <code>String</code> parameter's <code>.contains(...)</code> method to check whether it
contains this character. For example, <code>"abc".contains('b')</code> would return
<code>true</code> and <code>"abc".contains('e')</code> would return <code>false</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll want to test this function more thoroughly than the previous two. Try
calling it with several different strings, and run the program multiple
times. Remember that randomizing a number won't always changes it! You might
reroll a die whose value was three and end up rolling another three. If a
number you rerolled stays the same, that doesn't necessarily mean your code
isn't working. This makes it important to run the program multiple times when
testing.</p>
</li>

<p>Now it's time to finish the program by writing your <code>main</code> function. Your

<li>Create a dice array and roll all of the dice</li>
<li>Repeat until the user enters the command "quit":
<ul>
<li>Print the dice</li>
<li>Prompt the user for a command</li>
<li>Unless the user enters "quit", assume their command is "r" (abbreviating
"roll") followed by a space and one or more letters from a to e. For
example, "r abcde" or "r ebc".</li>
<li>Use your <code>rollSomeDice</code> to reroll the dice listed in the input</li>

<p>Before using my tests, run the program yourself and make sure it works as
expected. You'll be able to catch obvious bugs more quickly this way, and if
your program doesn't ever run, then my test program won't be very helpful.</p>
<p>If your program appears to work, then run the tests for your project and look at
the feedback. If your code passed every test, then this project is finished. If
not, then use the test feedback and the requirements under
<a href="project3.html#additional-details">Additional Details</a> to fix these errors and retest until
you've passed every test.</p>
<p>This project must be written as a "simple source file", which is still a preview
feature as of Java 24 and requires you to run the program with the
<code>--enable-preview</code> flag. If you've been following along in the lecture, then
this is how you've been writing Java programs and doesn't require you to do
anything differently.</p>
<p>If you've been ignoring the lectures and relying on other sources or previous
experience, then you're probably not familiar with simple source files. In that
case, you should go review the lecture material and make sure you understand how
we've learned to structure Java programs and perform input and output.</p>
<p>The tests that your program must pass require that your code is a simple source
file and that it uses the <code>print</code>, <code>println</code>, and <code>readln</code> functions for input
and output (not a scanner, console, or <code>System.out.println</code>). It also requires
that your code is not placed inside of a class definition and that you use the
simplified <code>void main() {...}</code> function instead of
<code>public static void main(String[] args) {...}</code>. If you ignore these
requirements, then your code will not pass the tests (which means it's
incomplete), and you may not see a helpful error message when it fails the

<p>Follow the steps below and write the program as directed. Test your code
frequently, <strong>at the bare minimum performing every test given in the steps.</strong></p>
<p>If your code is not working as expected, do not move on to the next step until
you have fixed it. Moving on without finishing a step correctly will make the
problem significantly harder to fix and likely add new problems as you continue
working. If you disregard this advice, then you may get to the end of the steps
and find it would actually be less work to start over from step 1 than to debug
the code you just finished writing.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The first version of our dice game only handled rerolling dice. This version
will add a scoring phase where we choose a category and earn points from our
dice. Our first step will be to move most of the code from <code>main</code> into a
function called <code>rerollPhase</code>. The <code>rerollPhase</code> function will be responsible
for letting the user reroll their dice before scoring.</p>
<p>The <code>main</code> function should still create the dice array and call
<code>rollAllDice</code>, but everything else can move to the <code>rerollPhase</code> function.
This function should have one parameter for the dice array.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to add a restriction to the reroll phase. In our finished game, the
user is only allowed to reroll up to two times before scoring their dice.
This means you'll need a variable to track the number of rerolls left.</p>
<p>We're also going to change the "quit" command to "s" for "skip". Instead of
quitting the game, this command will skip any remaining rerolls. The user is
not forced to reroll their dice if they're happy with what they currently
have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write the <code>countDice</code> function to help you calculate the user's score. This
function should iterate over an int array and count how many times a die
value appears in the array.</p>
<p>You can test this function in <code>main</code> by calling it with some sample arrays
and die values:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">println(countDice(new int[] {1, 2, 3, 3, 6}, 3));
println(countDice(new int[] {4, 4, 6, 3, 1}, 5));
// and so on...
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need a <code>printScores</code> function to display all of the score categories and
how many points they're worth for a given set of dice. This function must
take an int array (representing the dice) as its parameter. To start, I
recommend creating the following array at the beginning of your function:
<code>String[] categoryNames = new String[] {"Aces", "Twos", "Threes", "Fours", "Fives", "Sixes"};</code>.
This will give you an array with all of the category names and make it easier
to use a loop in this method.</p>
<p>Write a for loop that iterates over each category index and prints the
category number, name, and score. The category number is equal to the index
plus one, and this is what the user will type later to select the category.
The category name is the string from the <code>categoryNames</code> array shown above.
The score is calculated by multiplying the category number by how many times
it appears in the dice array (hint: use your <code>countDice</code> function).</p>
<p>For example, if the dice included three ones, then the first line of output
would be "1. Aces: 3". "Aces" is the name of the first category, its index is
0, its number is 1, and we would earn 3 points if we chose to score that
category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, create a function named <code>scorePhase</code> and call it in your <code>main</code>
function. The function must have an int array as its only paramater, and you
should pass the dice array when calling it in <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>This function must print the score categories (use <code>printScores</code>), then
prompt the user to choose a score category. If the user enters an invalid
category number, then you must continue to prompt them until they choose a
valid category number (use a while loop).</p>
<p>After the user has selected a category, print the score they've earned.</p>
</li>

<p>If you're interested in designing an alternative program for this project, then
talk to me during class or office hours. It would require you to write a
detailed proposal for your version of the project, which would take the place of
the normal requirements in this project.</p>
<!---->
<!-- If you choose this option, then you will design a new set of character creation -->
<!-- rules. This doesn't have to be related to D&D, and the rules don't even have to -->
<!-- be for a game. You could create a user account for a fictional social media app, -->
<!-- a profile for a professional athlete, or anything else you can think of. -->
<!---->
<!-- Your new design must meet the following requirements: -->
<!---->
<!-- - Your program generates additional information from the user's input. We want -->
<!--   our program to make creating this character (or account, profile, whatever) -->
<!--   more convenient for the user than if they did it by hand, so it should do a -->
<!--   reasonable amount of work for them. For example, the default program applies -->
<!--   adjustments to the character's ability scores and calculates their ability -->
<!--   modifiers. The user doesn't have to perform or understand these calculations -->
<!--   to create a character with that program. -->
<!-- - Your program includes one or two "advanced" features that either implement -->
<!--   more complex rules than the formulas and error-checking from 1.2 or allow the -->
<!--   user to do something with their character after it's finished. Some examples: -->
<!--   - the point-buy calculator in the default version of this project -->
<!--   - a quiz that determines some of your character's stats, like you might see in -->
<!--     older RPGs -->
<!--   - the ability to simulate skill checks, attacks, and other rolls you'd -->
<!--     commonly make while playing the game -->
<!---->
<!-- This program doesn't need to be realistic or practical. It only needs to make -->
<!-- sense in whatever scenario you have imagined for it. For example, the default -->
<!-- program doesn't come close to making a complete D&D character, but it still -->
<!-- accurately implements most of the character creation rules it does use. You -->
<!-- could use a character created with that program as a starting point for a real -->
<!-- D&D character. -->
<!---->

<p>If you chose the default version of this assignment, then run the tests for your
project and look at the feedback. If your code passed every test, then this step
is finished.</p>
<p>If you chose the custom version, then you should not attempt to test it with my

<h3 id="task-4-write-up"><a class="header" href="#task-4-write-up">Task 4: Write-Up</a></h3>
<p>After completing the program, answer the questions below in a separate document.
<strong>This is not an essay: do NOT double-space, and keep your answers to each
question separate</strong>. Your answers should be reasonably detailed and address each
question in full. I expect you to be accurate when describing your project, but
I'm otherwise not concerned with whether you provide the "correct" answer to a
question. Much of what I'm asking you for is your opinion or analysis of your
work. I want to know what <em>you</em> think so that I can assess your understanding
and provide useful feedback. If I disagree with you, then I will explain why and
offer suggestions without penalizing your grade.</p>
<p>Also, an important reminder: <strong>do not use ChatGPT or another LLM to assist with
or complete the write-up for you</strong>. The whole point is for you to think
critically about and explain your code. I do not care what ChatGPT "thinks"
about your work. Form your own opinions and justify them as best you can.</p>
<ol>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that was either challenging to
write or that you think is an example of particularly good code (it's up to you
what "good code" means, but you should be able to justify your opinion). Explain
why you chose this code: why is it an example of good code or what was
challenging about writing it? Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) and file where it appears in your program.</li>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that you think could be improved.
What do you dislike or want to change about this code? If you were to spend more
time on the project, how might you improve this code? To be clear, I'm not
asking you how the <em>program</em> could be better. I don't want to know what feature
you'd add or how you'd make it easier to use. I'm asking how part of the <em>code</em>
could be better. This might mean shorter, easier to read, less repetitive, or
something else that you value and think you could improve with additional time
and/or programming knowledge. Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) and file where it appears in your program.</li>

<h3 id="rulescalculations"><a class="header" href="#rulescalculations">Rules/Calculations</a></h3>
<p>This section covers all of the D&amp;D rules and calculations that your program must
implement. Other sections may refer to these requirements.</p>
<h4 id="ability-scores-rolling"><a class="header" href="#ability-scores-rolling">Ability Scores: Rolling</a></h4>
<p>The user can choose to roll their ability scores. Rolling each score uses the
following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roll four six-sided dice</li>
<li>Remove the die with the lowest value (in case of a tie, only remove one die)</li>
<li>Sum the remaining three dice to determine the ability score</li>
</ul>
<p>This method produces scores between 3 and 18 (inclusive). This allows for lower
and higher scores than a player could normally get through point buy, but the
player has less control over their scores. Our program is also assigning the
scores in the order they were rolled rather than letting the player assign them.</p>
<h4 id="ability-scores-point-buy"><a class="header" href="#ability-scores-point-buy">Ability Scores: Point Buy</a></h4>
<p>The user can choose to use D&amp;D 5e's point buy system to determine their ability
scores. The point buy system has the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user has a budget of 27 points to spend on their ability scores.</li>
<li>Each ability score defaults to 8 until the user changes it.</li>
<li>The user can choose any integer from 8 to 15 (inclusive) for an ability score,
provided they have enough points remaining to purchase that score. The score
costs are as follows:</li>
</ul>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Score</th><th>Point Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>8</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>7</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>9</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<h4 id="ancestry-adjustments"><a class="header" href="#ancestry-adjustments">Ancestry Adjustments</a></h4>
<p>The following table shows the ability score adjustments for each ancestry.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Ancestry</th><th>Str</th><th>Dex</th><th>Con</th><th>Int</th><th>Wis</th><th>Cha</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Dragonborn</td><td>+2</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>+1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dwarf</td><td></td><td></td><td>+2</td><td></td><td>+1</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Elf</td><td></td><td>+2</td><td></td><td>+1</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Gnome</td><td></td><td>+2</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>+1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Halfling</td><td></td><td>+2</td><td></td><td></td><td>+1</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Human</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<h4 id="ability-modifiers"><a class="header" href="#ability-modifiers">Ability Modifiers</a></h4>
<p>After adjusting a character's ability scores for their ancestry, we calculate
each ability's modifier. The score's main purpose is to determine this modifier,
whereas the modifier is the number we use for all of our calculations (hp, ac,
etc.). The table below shows the modifier for each possible ability score a
character can have in this program, but you can also calculate an ability's
modifier with the formula <code>modifier = score / 2 - 5</code>.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Score</th><th>Modifier</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>3</td><td>-4</td></tr>
<tr><td>4-5</td><td>-3</td></tr>
<tr><td>6-7</td><td>-2</td></tr>
<tr><td>8-9</td><td>-1</td></tr>
<tr><td>10-11</td><td>+0</td></tr>
<tr><td>12-13</td><td>+1</td></tr>
<tr><td>14-15</td><td>+2</td></tr>
<tr><td>16-17</td><td>+3</td></tr>
<tr><td>18-19</td><td>+4</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>+5</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<h4 id="classes"><a class="header" href="#classes">Classes</a></h4>
<p>The following table shows the properties of each class.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Class</th><th>Hit Die</th><th>AC Formula</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Barbarian</td><td>d12</td><td>10 + Dex + Con</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bard</td><td>d8</td><td>12 + Dex</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cleric</td><td>d8</td><td>15 + min(Dex, 2)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fighter</td><td>d10</td><td>18</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rogue</td><td>d8</td><td>12 + Dex</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wizard</td><td>d6</td><td>10 + Dex</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>All ability names in the AC formula refer to that ability's <em>modifier</em>, not its
score.</p>
<p>A note about the cleric's AC: we add 15 to either the cleric's dexterity
modifier or 2, whichever is less. This limits the cleric's dexterity modifier to
+2 or less for the purpose of calculating their armor class. You can use the
<code>Math.min</code> function to take the lower of two numbers.</p>
<h4 id="hit-points"><a class="header" href="#hit-points">Hit Points</a></h4>
<p>A character's hit points can be calculated by rolling their hit die or taking an
average value for each level. A hit die is written as "d" followed by the number
of sides on the die. For example, "d12" refers to a twelve-sided die. To
calculate a character's hit points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the maximum value (the number of sides on the die) for first level,
regardless of whether you are rolling or taking the average.</li>
<li>For each level after first:
<ul>
<li>If rolling, then roll the hit die and add the character's constitution
modifier to the result</li>
<li>If taking the average, then use 1 + half the die size + the character's
constitution modifier</li>
<li>A character gains a minimum of 1 hit point per level. If the constitution
modifier is negative, then you need to make sure the result for any given
level is not less than 1. One way to do this is to use <code>Math.max</code> to take
the larger value between 1 and the number you calculated in the previous
step.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, let's calculate the hit points of a 3rd level fighter with a
constitution modifier of -2. In the class table we can see that a fighter's hit
die is d10.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rolling (let's assume I roll a 2 and a 7 on a d10)
<ul>
<li>The fighter gains 8 hp at first level: 10 (max hit die value) plus -2 (con)</li>
<li>The fighter gains 1 hp at second level: 2 (number rolled on a d10) plus -2
(con) is less than 1, but a character must gain a minimum of 1 hp per level</li>
<li>The fighter gains 5 hp at second level: 7 (number rolled on a d10) plus -2
(con)</li>
<li>Total hp: 14</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Average
<ul>
<li>The fighter gains 8 hp at first level: 10 (max hit die value) plus -2 (con)</li>
<li>The fighter gains 4 hp at second and third level: 6 (half hit die plus one)
plus -2 (con)</li>
<li>Total hp: 16</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="io-format-4"><a class="header" href="#io-format-4">I/O Format</a></h3>
<p>This program must meet the following I/O requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The program accepts the required input in the order shown in the assignment
and does not expect any additional input.</li>
<li>The program produces each line of required output in the order specified in
the assignment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The program may include additional output before, between, and after lines of
required output. This additional output must be on a separate line from any
required output.</p>
<p>Your program must accept the following user input:</p>
<ul>
<li>(String) player's name</li>
<li>(String) character's name</li>
<li>(String) character's ancestry</li>
<li>(String) character's class</li>
<li>(int) character's level</li>
<li>(int) either "1" or "2" to indicate whether the user wishes to (1) roll their
hit points or (2) use average hit points</li>
<li>(int) either "1" or "2" to indicate whether the user wishes to generate their
scores with (1) point buy or (2) dice roll</li>
</ul>
<p>If the user chooses point buy, then your program must accept the following
input, which will repeat until the user finishes purchasing ability scores:</p>
<ul>
<li>Either an ability (the three-letter abbreviation, all lowercase) or the word
"done", which indicates that the user is finished with the point buy process.
If the user types "done", then no more input will follow.</li>
<li>A new score for the chosen ability (int)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the user enters invalid input of the correct type (for example, a level of -3
or a class of "knight"), then the program must print "Invalid choice, try
again." and make the user re-enter that piece of input. This message and reread
must repeat until the user enters valid input. You <strong>do not</strong> have to do this
for the wrong <em>type</em> of input, such as the user entering a level of "abc". That
would require exception handling, which you aren't expected to know for this
project.</p>
<p>Your program must print the following output during each iteration of the
point-buy process:</p>
<ul>
<li>The current value of each ability score formatted as the ability name's
three-letter abbreviation followed by the score. There must be a space after
the ability name, and the score must be right-aligned. These should also
(optionally) be indented.</li>
<li>The current budget, formatted as "Budget: X out of 27 points spent.". Replace
X with the total cost of the current set of ability scores.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example of the point-buy output:</p>
<pre><code>Budget: 20 out of 27 points spent.
    Str 15
    Dex  8
    Con 10
    Int 11
    Wis  9
    Cha 13
</code></pre>
<p>Your program must also print a warning if the user tries to exceed their budget
when setting a score. Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code>You can't afford to change dex from 8 to 15.
</code></pre>
<p>Your program must print the following output when displaying the character
sheet:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Player: </code> followed by the player name</li>
<li><code>Character: ___, level ___, ___ ___</code>, replacing the blanks with the
character's name, level, ancestry (lowercase), and class (lowercase) in that
order</li>
<li><code>HP: ___, AC: ___</code>, replacing the blanks with the character's hit points and
armor class</li>
<li><code>Abilities:</code></li>
<li>Each ability's three-letter abbreviation, score, and modifier indented and
formatted as they were in the previous project</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example of the character sheet output:</p>
<pre><code>Player: Alice
Character: Bob, level 15 elf bard
HP: 73, AC: 15
Abilities:
    Str 15 (+2)
    Dex 16 (+3)
    Con 10 (+0)
    Int 12 (+1)
    Wis  9 (-1)
    Cha 13 (+1)
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, you should include appropriate prompts throughout your program when
expecting user input. These prompts are ignored by the tests and should not
affect whether your program passes or fails any of them, so you can phrase these
prompts however you wish.</p>
<h3 id="random-numbers-2"><a class="header" href="#random-numbers-2">Random Numbers</a></h3>
<p>To ensure compatibility with my tests, there are a few additional requirements
whenever you have to generate a random number:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each random number is generated by a function from the <code>Dice</code> class.</li>
<li>Your program "rolls" dice in the order implied by the rest of these
directions. For example, when you are rolling ability scores you should roll
them in the listed order: first strength, then dexterity, then constitution,
and so on.</li>
<li>Your program does not roll extra dice. For example, calling one of the Dice
class's functions to generate a random number when you don't need to roll a
die, or rolling each die twice instead of once.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="functions-2"><a class="header" href="#functions-2">Functions</a></h3>
<p>Your program must include all of the functions described below.</p>
<p>Unless they are required to handle specific errors, your functions can assume
that all of their parameters contain valid input.</p>
<h4 id="rollabilityscores"><a class="header" href="#rollabilityscores"><code>rollAbilityScores</code></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Return type: <code>int[]</code></li>
<li>Parameters: none</li>

and summing the three highest rolls.</p>
<h4 id="purchaseabilityscores"><a class="header" href="#purchaseabilityscores"><code>purchaseAbilityScores</code></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Return type: <code>int[]</code></li>
<li>Parameters: <strong>none</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Must create and return an array of six integers representing a character's
ability scores. The user will set the scores following the standard point buy
rules for D&amp;D 5th edition.</p>
<p>Must repeat the following process until the user is finished:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display the current ability scores and point budget.</li>
<li>Prompt the user for either an ability (the three-letter abbreviation) or the
word "done", which will end the process and return the current set of ability
scores.</li>
<li>Prompt the user to enter a new score for the chosen ability. This must be an
integer between 8 and 15 (inclusive).</li>
<li>If the user has enough points left in their budget to set the chosen ability
to the chosen score, then the ability score and point budget must update.</li>
<li>If the user does not have enough points, then the program will print "You
can't afford to change ABILITY from OLD to NEW." before continuing. <code>ABILITY</code>
must be replaced with the abbreviated name of the ability, <code>OLD</code> must be
replaced with the current score, and <code>NEW</code> must be replaced with the new score
entered by the user.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Must calculate and return the character's hit points using the rolling method
described for hit points.</p>
<p>Remember that your program must simulate random dice rolls by calling the

<!-- start working on or submit the project. -->
<!---->
<!-- Your proposal must answer the following questions: -->
<!---->
<!-- 1. Explain the rules of your game in enough detail that I or another person -->
<!--    could play your game using real dice. If you are using an existing game, then -->
<!--    you can summarize the rules (in your own words), state any changes you are -->
<!--    making to the rules, and link to the official rules or another source that -->
<!--    explains them in detail. I expect you to play your game a few times to ensure -->
<!--    you understand the rules and that any rules you changed or designed yourself -->
<!--    work in practice. -->
<!-- 2. Explain how the user would interact with your program. Describe any commands -->
<!--    or input the user would be expected to type while using the program and how -->
<!--    the program should respond. -->
<!-- 3. Describe three new functions you expect to create while implementing this -->
<!--    program. What do these functions do, what parameters do they require, and -->
<!--    what (if anything) do they return? These must be new functions that did not -->
<!--    already exist in 2.1 or 2.2, not modified versions of functions you wrote for -->
<!--    those programs. -->
<!---->
<!-- Your answers to questions 2 and 3 may change as you write your program, and -->
<!-- that's okay! As long as your game's rules remain the same, you do not need to -->
<!-- submit a new proposal. You will address changes to the functions and user input -->
<!-- in the writeup task. -->

<p>If you chose the default option, then refer to the
<a href="project6.html#additional-details">additional details</a> section for specific requirements.</p>
<p>If you chose the custom option, then you should refer to your accepted proposal
for specific requirements and ignore the additional details section of this
assignment.</p>
<h4 id="updating-main"><a class="header" href="#updating-main">Updating <code>main</code></a></h4>
<p>To help you get started, here's an outline of the <code>main</code> function for the
default version of the program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create the following arrays, which will be passed to and used by other
functions in your program:
<ul>
<li>an array of thirteen strings for the category names</li>
<li>an array of thirteen ints for the category scores</li>
<li>an array of thirteen booleans for the availability of these categories and
set each element to <code>true</code></li>
<li>an array of five ints for the dice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a loop to play thirteen rounds of the game, which should:
<ul>
<li>Print the round number</li>
<li>Roll the dice</li>
<li>Call <code>rerollPhase</code></li>
<li>Call <code>scorePhase</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Print the final score card after the loop terminates.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="task-3-run-tests-1"><a class="header" href="#task-3-run-tests-1">Task 3: Run Tests</a></h3>
<p>If you chose the default version of this assignment, then run the tests for your
project and look at the feedback. If your code passed every test, then this step
is finished.</p>
<p>If you chose the custom version, then you should not attempt to test it with my
test program. Instead, you should run your program enough to be confident that
it works correctly under normal circumstances. If it is difficult for me to use
your program without encountering significant bugs or errors, then you will have
to revise and resubmit the project.</p>
<h3 id="task-4-write-up-1"><a class="header" href="#task-4-write-up-1">Task 4: Write-Up</a></h3>
<p>After completing the program, answer the questions below in a separate document.
<strong>This is not an essay: do NOT double-space, and keep your answers to each
question separate</strong>. Your answers should be reasonably detailed and address each
question in full. I expect you to be accurate when describing your project, but
I'm otherwise not concerned with whether you provide the "correct" answer to a
question. Much of what I'm asking you for is your opinion or analysis of your
work. I want to know what <em>you</em> think so that I can assess your understanding
and provide useful feedback. If I disagree with you, then I will explain why and
offer suggestions without penalizing your grade.</p>
<p>Also, an important reminder: <strong>do not use ChatGPT or another LLM to assist with
or complete the write-up for you</strong>. The whole point is for you to think
critically about and explain your code. I do not care what ChatGPT "thinks"
about your work. Form your own opinions and justify them as best you can.</p>
<ol>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that was either challenging to
write or that you think is an example of particularly good code (it's up to you
what "good code" means, but you should be able to justify your opinion). Explain
why you chose this code: why is it an example of good code or what was
challenging about writing it? Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) and file where it appears in your program.</li>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that you think could be improved.
What do you dislike or want to change about this code? If you were to spend more
time on the project, how might you improve this code? To be clear, I'm not
asking you how the <em>program</em> could be better. I don't want to know what feature
you'd add or how you'd make it easier to use. I'm asking how part of the <em>code</em>
could be better. This might mean shorter, easier to read, less repetitive, or
something else that you value and think you could improve with additional time
and/or programming knowledge. Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) and file where it appears in your program.</li>
</ol>
<!-- Additionally, answer the following questions if you designed your own program: -->
<!---->
<!-- 3. Explain how to use your program. You can assume the user has read the rules -->
<!--    of your dice game, but don't assume they know anything about how to use your -->
<!--    program yet. These directions and your program's prompts must be sufficient -->
<!--    for someone to learn how to use your program without reading any of the code. -->
<!--    If your prompts are good, then you may not need to write much for this -->
<!--    question! -->
<!-- 4. What changes, if any, did you make to the user input you described in your -->
<!--    proposal? Why did you make these changes? -->
<!-- 5. What changes, if any, did you make to the functions you described in your -->
<!--    proposal? Why did you make these changes? -->
<h2 id="deliverables-5"><a class="header" href="#deliverables-5">Deliverables</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Your <code>DiceGame3.java</code> file</li>

<h3 id="io-format-5"><a class="header" href="#io-format-5">I/O Format</a></h3>
<p>This program must meet the following I/O requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The program accepts the required input in the order shown in the assignment
and does not expect any additional input.</li>
<li>The program produces each line of required output in the order specified in
the assignment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The program may include additional output before, between, and after lines of
required output. This additional output must be on a separate line from any
required output.</p>
<p>Your program must accept the same user input as in Project 4 for every round of
the game. There will be 13 rounds in a full game.</p>
<p>Your program must print the same output as in Project 4, but with the following
changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the beginning of each round print "Round X", where X is the round number
(starting at 1)</li>
<li>During the score phase:
<ul>
<li>A list of options produced by this project's version of the <code>printScore</code>
function</li>
<li>The message "ERROR: INVALID CATEGORY" when user chooses a category that
isn't a number from 1 to 13</li>
<li>The message "ERROR: CATEGORY UNAVAILABLE" when the user chooses a category
that was already taken</li>
<li>The number of points received for the chosen category and that category's
name formatted as "You receive X points for Y."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After the final round:
<ul>
<li>The line "Final Score Card:"</li>
<li>The output of the <code>printScore</code> function</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, your program should include reasonable prompts for information and
any additional text that you think would make it easier for the user to interact
with the program. It's up to you how much of this to include, what exactly to
say, and how to format it. The tests will not check these prompts.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="test-script"><a class="header" href="#test-script">Test Script</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: I'm posting this early with just the I/O samples for projects 1-4. I'll
update the files on OneDrive with samples for 5 and 6 early next week.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="setup"><a class="header" href="#setup">Setup</a></h2>
<p>You can download the test script (<code>io_test</code>) and the io samples (<code>io.zip</code>) from
the shared OneDrive folder. Move the test script to your projects folder, and
extract the io archive to a folder named <code>io</code> in your projects folder. You can
do this with the following commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># These commands assume io.zip and io_test are in your downloads folder
# The cd command should use the actual path to your projects folder
cd path/to/your/projects/folder
cp ~/Downloads/io_test ./io_test
unzip ~/Downloads/io.zip
</code></pre>
<p>If you're using the Safari browser on a Mac, then it's possible your browser
already extracted the zip when you downloaded it. In that case, you can just
move the extracted <code>io</code> folder to your projects folder.</p>
<p>The test script and extracted <code>io</code> folder should now reside in your projects
folder along with all of your programs. If you run the <code>ls</code> command in your
projects folder, then you should see the following:</p>
<pre><code>CharacterSheet1.java
CharacterSheet2.java
CharacterSheet3.java
Dice.java
DiceGame1.java
DiceGame2.java
DiceGame3.java
io
io_test
</code></pre>
<p>Some of the programs may be missing from that list if you haven't yet started
them, but all of the programs you are working on should be in this folder. If
you run <code>ls io</code>, then you should see folders numbered 1 through 6. These contain
the input and output samples for each project.</p>
<p>If <code>ls io</code> shows another folder named <code>io</code>, then try <code>ls io/io</code>. If that shows
numbers from 1 to 6, then your <code>io</code> folder is inside of a second folder named
<code>io</code>. You can fix that with <code>mv io/io/* io/</code> or by manually moving those folders
from the inner <code>io</code> folder to the outer <code>io</code> folder. Run <code>rmdir io/io</code> after you
move the numbered folders to delete the empty extra <code>io</code> folder. This command is
safe and will only work on an empty folder.</p>
<p>Finally, you should make the <code>io_test</code> script executable so you can run it more
easily:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">chmod u+x io_test
</code></pre>
<h3 id="test-version-of-dicejava"><a class="header" href="#test-version-of-dicejava">Test Version of <code>Dice.java</code></a></h3>
<p>When testing Projects 3, 4, 5, and 6, you will need a modified version of
<code>Dice.java</code> and an extra line of code at the start of your main function. Add
the following line to the beginning of your main function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Dice.init();
</code></pre>
<p>Then replace the <code>Dice.java</code> used by your projects with the following version:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">import java.util.Random;
import java.io.IO;

/**
 * Modified version of the Dice class for use during testing. To make your
 * code from Projects 3+ compatible with the test script, add the following
 * line to the start of your main function:
 *
 * Dice.init();
 *
 * This will read the first input as the seed for a random number generator and
 * ensure your program receives the same series of "random" dice rolls as the
 * code that produced the expected output for that I/O sample.

<p>When manually testing these projects, you will now have to enter a "seed" value
for the random number generator when you begin running your program. The random
numbers generated by the dice functions depend on this seed, and reusing the
same seed will produce the same sequence of "random" numbers. This allows your
program to be tested against specific expected output on projects that rely on
some random elements.</p>
<p>You may also find a consistent sequence of numbers instead of random values
helpful for manual testing. If you would like to use a random seed, then you can
always just press enter without entering a number to let the program run with an
arbitrary seed.</p>
<h2 id="manual-testing"><a class="header" href="#manual-testing">Manual Testing</a></h2>
<p>Before using the test script, it's important to test your program manually. The
script is only going to help you find mistakes in your code; it won't help you
fix them. If your code crashes, contains syntax errors, or has obvious mistakes,
then it will be easier to identify and fix them with manual testing. The test
script will not function correctly if your program can't run without errors.</p>
<p>Run your program with the <code>java</code> command and provide reasonable input. For
example, you could run project 1 with the command
<code>java --enable-preview CharacterSheet1.java</code>. If your program crashes, if Java
reports syntax errors, or if there are obvious mistakes in the output, then you
should fix those before using the test script.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-test-script"><a class="header" href="#using-the-test-script">Using the Test Script</a></h2>
<p>To test your program with the first I/O sample, use the command <code>./io_test X 1</code>,
where <code>X</code> is the project's number. For example, <code>./io_test 1 1</code> would test
Project 1 with just the first sample. Starting with the first sample will help
you more quickly catch formatting mistakes that would cause your program to fail
all or most of the tests.</p>
<p>Once your program passes the first I/O sample, try testing it with all of them.
To test your program with all of the I/O samples, use the command
<code>./io_test X all</code>, where <code>X</code> is the project's number. For example,
<code>./io_test 1 all</code> would run the test for Project 1. The script should report any
I/O samples that your program failed.</p>
<p>If your program fails an I/O sample, then you can check that specific sample
with <code>./io_test X Y</code>, where <code>X</code> is the project number and <code>Y</code> is the sample
number. For example, <code>./io_test 1 3</code> would check the third I/O sample for
Project 1.</p>
<h2 id="running-io-samples-without-the-test-script"><a class="header" href="#running-io-samples-without-the-test-script">Running I/O Samples Without the Test Script</a></h2>
<p>The test script only shows which lines from the expected output were missing
from your program's output. You can check your program's full output for that
I/O sample by using input redirection. For example, to run Project 2 with its
seventh sample input, you would use the command
<code>java --enable-preview CharacterSheet2.java &lt; io/2/in7.txt</code>. You can open the
files <code>io/2/in7.txt</code> and <code>io/2/out7.txt</code> to view the input and expected output
for that sample.</p>
<p>Your program passes the test for an I/O sample if <strong>every line of the expected
output appears in your program's output in the same order and on its own line.</strong>
This means that any extra output your program produces will <strong>not</strong> affect the
test as long as it appears on a separate line from the required output. This
also means that if your output is in the wrong order, then some of it may
register as missing. The test should also ignore leading and trailing whitespace
in your output.</p>
<h2 id="submitting-the-project"><a class="header" href="#submitting-the-project">Submitting the Project</a></h2>
<p>Your project is ready to submit when it passes the test with all I/O samples. Do
not upload it to Blackboard until it passes, or it will just be marked
incomplete without further comment. You only need to upload the file(s) listed
in the project's deliverables section when you submit your work.</p>
<h3 id="tricking-the-test-script"><a class="header" href="#tricking-the-test-script">Tricking the Test Script</a></h3>
<p>It's very easy to trick the test script into passing your code. I will still
look at submitted code to ensure it is not plagiarized and that it actually
attempts to complete the assignment as directed. If you try to fool the test
script instead of completing the assignment, then this will be treated as a
violation of the school's academic integrity policy.</p>
<p>As an example, the following program would pass every test if you copied all of
the text from the output files into the print statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">void main() {

println("""
This is a multiline string literal. You can copy as much text here as you want,
and you can include line breaks without \n. If you copy all of the text from the
output files, then this program will print that text and fool the test script.

COPY TEXT HERE

The script is not hard to fool, but code designed to fool the script is not hard
to spot, and it will NOT lead to you getting credit for the assignment.
