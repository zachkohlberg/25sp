<p>Using the wheels library, create a scene involving several objects. The scene
can be whatever you want as long as it's appropriate for a classroom setting.</p>
<p>The wheels library provides several classes to display simple shapes. You can
use these to construct all of the objects in your scene. You can see a list of
these shape classes in the wheels documentation on Blackboard.</p>
<h2 id="primary-topics"><a class="header" href="#primary-topics">Primary Topics</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Wheels graphics library</li>
<li>Composition</li>
<li>Relative positioning</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setup-and-prerequisites"><a class="header" href="#setup-and-prerequisites">Setup and Prerequisites</a></h2>
<p>Download the wheels library and documentation from Blackboard and learn how to
import it into a project. Make sure you can run the following wheels program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class Main extends wheels.users.Frame {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Main();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This program should display a mostly empty window with a quit button.</p>
<h2 id="tasks"><a class="header" href="#tasks">Tasks</a></h2>
<h3 id="task-1-design"><a class="header" href="#task-1-design">Task 1: Design</a></h3>
<p>To start, design a scene with at least three different types of objects. For
example, your scene might be a bird flying through the sky with the sun and some
clouds in the background. The bird, sun, and clouds would be our three types of
object. Once you have an idea, think about how you could create these objects
using wheels shapes (rectangles, ellipses, lines, and rounded rectangles). Our
sun, for example, might be an ellipse with several lines radiating from it. I
recommend drawing a quick sketch of the objects using those shapes. This will
help you figure out how to create the objects using code.</p>
<p>Once you've designed your scene, you need to design an object that functions as
a component of another object in your scene. This component must appear multiple
times in your code: either multiple times within the same object or in multiple
types of object. Using our example, a single wing could be used as a component
because our bird needs two of them. If we were going to include two different
types of birds in our scene, then we might make a beak component and use it once
in each bird class.</p>
<p>In a separate document, answer the following questions about your design. This
is your <strong>design writeup</strong>, and it must be submitted with the project.</p>
<ol>
<li>Summarize the entire scene.</li>
<li>Describe three types of objects in your scene. What does each object
represent, and how will you construct it out of wheels shapes? Your scene can
include more types beyond these three, but the three you describe must meet
the following requirements:
<ul>
<li>The object is composed of at least three other objects (wheels shapes or
component objects)</li>
<li>The object is represented by its own class in your program</li>
<li>The scene must include multiple instances of at least one object, so note
an object that appears more than once in the scene</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Describe a component object that appears in the scene. What does this
component object represent, how will you construct it out of wheels shapes,
and what other object(s) will use it as a component? This component object
must meet the following requirements:
<ul>
<li>The component is composed of at least three wheels shapes</li>
<li>The component is part of at least one type of object described in the
previous question</li>
<li>The component is either used multiple times in one object (for example, a
bird with two instances of a wing component) or in different objects (for
example, an eagle and an owl that each have a beak component)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, note that I expect you to design your own scene and write these
descriptions yourself. Your scene should not be based on a classmate's scene or
the example given in this section, and you are not allowed to use ChatGPT or
another LLM to assist with this writeup.</p>
<h3 id="task-2-program"><a class="header" href="#task-2-program">Task 2: Program</a></h3>
<p>Write a wheels program that displays your scene. It must include the following
classes:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <code>Main</code> class that extends <code>wheels.users.Frame</code> and includes a <code>main</code> method
that launches the program. Make sure you name this class correctly and leave
it in the default package so that my script can run your program.</li>
<li>One class for each type of object described in your design writeup. The
classes should be named appropriately (upper camel case names that identify
what type of object they represent).</li>
<li>A class that defines the component described in your design writeup.</li>
</ol>
<p>Feel free to include more than the five required classes if you want to add more
to your scene.</p>
<p>Your three object types and your component must include the following
constructors and methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>setLocation</code> method that moves the entire object to the given location</li>
<li>A <code>setColor</code> method that changes at least one of the object's colors</li>
<li>A default constructor that initializes all of the object's components and
calls the above setter methods</li>
<li>A parameterized constructor that accepts x, y coordinates for the object's
location and at least one color; these parameters must be used to call the
above setter methods</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="group-work"><a class="header" href="#group-work">Group Work</a></h4>
<p>During one practice activity we worked on a component class for this project. If
you worked with a group on that component, emailed the <em>finished</em> code to me by
2/17, and received a confirmation from me that all group members may use this
code in their projects, then you can use that code in your project with proper
credit to the rest of your from class group. Otherwise, all code in the project
must be your own work.</p>
<h3 id="task-3-reflection"><a class="header" href="#task-3-reflection">Task 3: Reflection</a></h3>
<p>Answer the following questions after completing your program. This reflection
can be in the same document as your design writeup as long as long as it is
clearly separated from your answers to the design questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Did you include any other setter methods in one of your classes to change its
other properties (such as rotation or size)?
<ul>
<li>If yes, then describe that method and why you included it.</li>
<li>If no, then what additional property would you want to add a setter for?
How would this help you improve your scene?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that was either challenging to
write or that you think is an example of particularly good code (it's up to you
what "good code" means, but you should be able to justify your opinion). Explain
why you chose this code: why is it an example of good code or what was
challenging about writing it? Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) and file where it appears in your program.</li>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that you think could be improved.
What do you dislike or want to change about this code? If you were to spend more
time on the project, how might you improve this code? To be clear, I'm not
asking you how the <em>program</em> could be better. I don't want to know what feature
you'd add or how you'd make it easier to use. I'm asking how part of the <em>code</em>
could be better. This might mean shorter, easier to read, less repetitive, or
something else that you value and think you could improve with additional time
and/or programming knowledge. Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) and file where it appears in your program.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="deliverables"><a class="header" href="#deliverables">Deliverables</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Your design writeup</li>
<li>Your <code>Main.java</code> file</li>
<li>All java files for objects displayed in your scene</li>
<li>Your reflection</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="submission"><a class="header" href="#submission">Submission</a></h2>
<p><strong>Before submitting this assignment, make sure you understand and abide by the
Academic Integrity policy in our syllabus. This is particularly important if you
received any assistance, made use of an LLM, or used resources that were not
provided in class.</strong></p>
<p>When uploading your code, package it in one of the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you're using Eclipse, then right-click on your project and choose
"Export". Under "General", select "Archive File" and click "Next &gt;". Ensure
that all code for the project is checked, select a destination, and click
"Finish". Note: the "Save in zip format" and "Create directory structure for
files" options should be checked, and if you've linked to files outside the
project you'll also need to check "Resolve and export linked resources".</li>
<li>If all of your classes are in the default package, then you can directly
attach each of the .java files to the Blackboard submission or zip them in a
folder named "src".</li>
<li>If some of your classes are not in the default package and you don't want to
use Eclipse's export function, then you must place them in a folder named
"src" with a directory structure matching the packages, zip that src folder,
and upload the zipped folder with your submission.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order for this project to count as complete:</p>
<ul>
<li>upload all deliverables in a single Blackboard submission before the deadline
(don't split it up between multiple submissions)</li>
<li>your code must not contain any syntax errors</li>
<li>the design writeup and reflection must be in PDF, ODT, DOC, DOCX, or plaintext
files</li>
<li>your work must demonstrate completion of each task in the assignment</li>
</ul>
<p>If you appear to have ignored portions of a task, did not submit the project as
directed, or otherwise demonstrate negligence in your submission, then it will
be marked "incomplete". If there are issues with your submission, but you appear
to have made an honest effort to complete every task as directed, then your
submission will be marked "revise" with comments requesting changes or
additional work to complete the assignment.</p>
