<p>Using the wheels library, create a program with interactive elements. This can
be a scene like in the previous project, or something completely different.</p>
<p>Add interaction to wheels objects by extending wheels shapes (such as
<code>Rectangle</code> and <code>Ellipse</code>) and overriding one or more of the mouse methods (such
as <code>mousePressed</code>, <code>mouseReleased</code>, <code>mouseClicked</code>, or <code>mouseDragged</code>).</p>
<h2 id="primary-topics"><a class="header" href="#primary-topics">Primary Topics</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Composition</li>
<li>Inheritance</li>
<li>Interfaces</li>
<li>Polymorphism</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setup-and-prerequisites"><a class="header" href="#setup-and-prerequisites">Setup and Prerequisites</a></h2>
<p>You should complete project 1 before starting this project. I also recommend
using your scene from project 1 as a starting point for project 2.</p>
<h2 id="tasks"><a class="header" href="#tasks">Tasks</a></h2>
<h3 id="task-1-design"><a class="header" href="#task-1-design">Task 1: Design</a></h3>
<p>Design at least two interactive elements to include in your program. You can add
some UI elements to the scene from your previous project, allow direct
interaction with objects in the scene, or do something else entirely. To give a
few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>A button that triggers some action when clicked</li>
<li>A slider that gradually adjusts some property of an object</li>
<li>A composite object that can be dragged around the screen</li>
<li>An object that responds differently depending on where it is clicked</li>
</ul>
<p>In a separate document, answer the following questions about your design. This
is your <strong>design writeup</strong>, and it must be submitted with the project.</p>
<ol>
<li>Describe your two interactive elements and how interacting with them affects
the program. For an object to count, it must meet the following requirements:
<ul>
<li>The interaction involves mouse input</li>
<li>The object is visible</li>
<li>The interaction is not limited to a single wheels shape (for example, an
ellipse that can be dragged around on its own is too simple to count)</li>
<li>The interaction causes a visible change in one or more objects</li>
<li>Each interaction must involve a different type of change (for example,
moving, resizing, or changing an object's color)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, note that I expect you to design your own objects and write these
descriptions yourself. You objects should not be based on a classmate's objects,
and you are not allowed to use ChatGPT or another LLM to assist with this
writeup.</p>
<h3 id="task-2-program"><a class="header" href="#task-2-program">Task 2: Program</a></h3>
<p>Write a wheels program that displays these objects. It must include the
following classes:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <code>Main</code> class that extends <code>wheels.users.Frame</code> and includes a <code>main</code> method
that launches the program. Make sure you name this class correctly and leave
it in the default package so that my script can run your program.</li>
<li>For each interactive object:
<ul>
<li>At least one subclass of a wheels shape that reacts to mouse input.</li>
<li>Another object that visibly responds to the mouse input.</li>
<li>An interface that links the wheels shape(s) to the object(s) that they
control. The wheels shape(s) must have an <strong>association</strong> with this
interface, not the other object. The other object must implement this
interface.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You're free to include more classes in your project, but at a minimum you need a
classes and interfaces that meet the requirements above.</p>
<h4 id="group-work"><a class="header" href="#group-work">Group Work</a></h4>
<p>During one practice activity we worked on a component class for this project. If
you worked with a group on that component, emailed the <em>finished</em> code to me by
the end of class, and received a confirmation from me that all group members may
use this code in their projects, then you can use that code in your project with
proper credit to the rest of your from class group. Otherwise, all code in the
project must be your own work.</p>
<h3 id="task-3-reflection--uml"><a class="header" href="#task-3-reflection--uml">Task 3: Reflection &amp; UML</a></h3>
<p>Answer the following questions after completing your program. This reflection
can be in the same document as your design writeup as long as long as it is
clearly separated from your answers to the design questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>For each of your two interactive objects, create a UML diagram that includes
the following classes and relationships (don't include any class members in
the diagram):
<ul>
<li>The interface used in the interaction</li>
<li>The wheels shape subclass(es) responsible for detecting mouse input</li>
<li>Any classes that implement your interface and the appropriate arrow for
this relationship</li>
<li>Any associations or composition relationships between the above classes and
interfaces</li>
<li>The superclass of each of the above classes and the appropriate arrow for
this relationship</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that was either challenging to
write or that you think is an example of particularly good code (it's up to you
what "good code" means, but you should be able to justify your opinion). Explain
why you chose this code: why is it an example of good code or what was
challenging about writing it? Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) and file where it appears in your program.</li>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that you think could be improved.
What do you dislike or want to change about this code? If you were to spend more
time on the project, how might you improve this code? To be clear, I'm not
asking you how the <em>program</em> could be better. I don't want to know what feature
you'd add or how you'd make it easier to use. I'm asking how part of the <em>code</em>
could be better. This might mean shorter, easier to read, less repetitive, or
something else that you value and think you could improve with additional time
and/or programming knowledge. Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) and file where it appears in your program.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="deliverables"><a class="header" href="#deliverables">Deliverables</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Your design writeup</li>
<li>Your <code>Main.java</code> file</li>
<li>All other java files required for the program to run</li>
<li>Your reflection</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="submission"><a class="header" href="#submission">Submission</a></h2>
<p><strong>Before submitting this assignment, make sure you understand and abide by the
Academic Integrity policy in our syllabus. This is particularly important if you
received any assistance, made use of an LLM, or used resources that were not
provided in class.</strong></p>
<p>When uploading your code, package it in one of the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you're using Eclipse, then right-click on your project and choose
"Export". Under "General", select "Archive File" and click "Next &gt;". Ensure
that all code for the project is checked, select a destination, and click
"Finish". Note: the "Save in zip format" and "Create directory structure for
files" options should be checked, and if you've linked to files outside the
project you'll also need to check "Resolve and export linked resources".</li>
<li>If all of your classes are in the default package, then you can directly
attach each of the .java files to the Blackboard submission or zip them in a
folder named "src".</li>
<li>If some of your classes are not in the default package and you don't want to
use Eclipse's export function, then you must place them in a folder named
"src" with a directory structure matching the packages, zip that src folder,
and upload the zipped folder with your submission.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order for this project to count as complete:</p>
<ul>
<li>upload all deliverables in a single Blackboard submission before the deadline
(don't split it up between multiple submissions)</li>
<li>your code must not contain any syntax errors</li>
<li>the design writeup and reflection must be in PDF, ODT, DOC, DOCX, or plaintext
files</li>
<li>your work must demonstrate completion of each task in the assignment</li>
</ul>
<p>If you appear to have ignored portions of a task, did not submit the project as
directed, or otherwise demonstrate negligence in your submission, then it will
be marked "incomplete". If there are issues with your submission, but you appear
to have made an honest effort to complete every task as directed, then your
submission will be marked "revise" with comments requesting changes or
additional work to complete the assignment.</p>
<p>A submission marked "revise" can be resubmitted without the usual limit on
weekly submissions, and it can be resubmitted up to one week after the deadline
for that project. A revised project will be marked "complete" if it addresses
all of the original feedback.</p>
