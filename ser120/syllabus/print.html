<h2 id="office-hours"><a class="header" href="#office-hours">Office Hours</a></h2>
<p>I am a part-time faculty member and do not have an office on campus. If I am
available for in person office hours, then it will be noted in a schedule posted
to Blackboard. These times do not require an appointment.</p>
<p>We can also schedule a remote meeting on a weekday if you are not able to attend
my in-person office hours. If you'd like to meet remotely, then please send me
an email with your availability over the next several days. I'll try to find a
time that works for both of us and schedule a Zoom meeting.</p>
<h2 id="blackboard"><a class="header" href="#blackboard">Blackboard</a></h2>
<p>I will post or link to all course material and assignments on Blackboard. If you
want to find something or submit an assignment, go to our Blackboard site and
look in the appropriate page. If you think I forgot to post something, then send
me an email and I'll either post it or tell you where to find it.</p>
<h2 id="email"><a class="header" href="#email">Email</a></h2>
<p>My email is <a href="mailto:zckohlberg@qu.edu">zckohlberg@qu.edu</a>. I check my email most weekdays and try to
respond to all emails within 24 hours. If you email me after Friday morning or
on the weekend, then I probably won't see it until Monday. You're still welcome
to email me at any time.</p>
<p>I will answer most questions via email if you don't want to ask in person. If
you're asking for help with an assignment or other coding issue, then please
attach your code (the text file, not a screenshot). Try to include as much
relevant information as possible and be specific about what you want to know.
This helps me give you a useful answer more quickly.</p>
<p>If you want me to do something more involved than answer a few questions, such
as review your code or help you debug a program, then you should meet with me
during office hours. I'm happy to help you with coding, debugging, and other
tasks as long as you're the one doing the task. You should not come to office
hours or send an email expecting me to do your work for you.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="class-meetings"><a class="header" href="#class-meetings">Class Meetings</a></h1>
<h2 id="instructor-absence"><a class="header" href="#instructor-absence">Instructor Absence</a></h2>
<p>I may hold class remotely via Zoom if I cannot attend the meeting in person (for
example, if I'm sick). If I need to cancel class, then I will notify everyone as
early as possible in a Blackboard announcement.</p>
<h2 id="class-structure"><a class="header" href="#class-structure">Class Structure</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X348t-0snwL5IBkAaRMbVyEt2w_RBUYIcS2rMo2mQxw/edit?usp=sharing">course schedule</a> will have the agenda
for each class meeting, and all activities and material from class will be
posted online. If you want me to cover a specific topic or spend more time on
something, then let me know and I will try to fit it into the agenda for an
upcoming class.</p>
<p>Currently, my plan is to split each week into one day of review/lecture
(Mondays) and one day of in-class practice (Wednesdays). You should show up to
each class prepared for what we're doing that day, which means completing any
reading or other homework assignments before class starts. Showing up to a group
activity unprepared is disrespectful to the people you are working with and
makes it harder for the group to work on the activity.</p>
<h2 id="attendance-policy"><a class="header" href="#attendance-policy">Attendance Policy</a></h2>
<p>You should attend class whenever possible, but you do not need my permission to
miss class or leave early. You also don't need to explain absences to me.
However, I would appreciate knowing what's going on if you have to miss multiple
classes in a row or are absent frequently. The university expects me to contact
your academic advisor when you have excessive or consecutive unexcused absences.</p>
<p>If you are feeling sick or suspect you may have COVID, the flu, or another
contagious illness, then please stay home and focus on recovering. You will be
okay if you miss a few classes, and you're not likely to get much out of class
while you aren't feeling well. Attending class while sick also poses a risk to
everyone else. If you want to attend while you suspect you have a contagious
illness, then please wear a mask.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="course-material"><a class="header" href="#course-material">Course Material</a></h1>
<h2 id="primary-resources"><a class="header" href="#primary-resources">Primary Resources</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reading Assignments</strong>: I may use several sources for reading assignments:
<ul>
<li><strong>Slides</strong>: I have slides created by professors who have taught this class
in the past, which I will post on Blackboard.</li>
<li><strong>Notes/Handouts</strong>: If I have time during the semester, then I may write
some notes or handouts to give as reading assignments.</li>
<li><strong>Textbook</strong>: You don't need a textbook for this class, but much of the
material is based on Object-Oriented Programming in Java, A Graphical
Approach, by Kathryn E. Sanders and Andries van Dam. The university's
library should have a copy of that book if you would like to read it. I may
also post small portions of the book on Blackboard for reading assignments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lecture Notes</strong>: Some classes will be more traditional lectures in which I
cover examples and write notes on the board. You should take your own notes
during class and ask a classmate for their notes if you're absent.</li>
<li><strong>Class Activities/Examples</strong>: We will have practice activities, coding
demonstrations, and reviews during class. Activities will be posted before
class, and any material (code, diagrams, etc.) created during class will be
posted after that class when possible.</li>
<li><strong>Videos</strong>: I may create some video lectures and tutorials, but I probably
won't have time to do this for most topics.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="software"><a class="header" href="#software">Software</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Text Editor/IDE</strong>: I recommend <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse</a>
for SER120 and SER120L, but you're free to use any editor you're comfortable
with. Assignment directions will assume you are using Eclipse, and you should
be prepared to figure out how to perform the same tasks in your own editor if
you choose not to use Eclipse. Don't expect me to help you troubleshoot
another editor or IDE.</li>
<li><strong>Java</strong>: You should have Java installed from CSC110. If not, then please
install the JDK for a recent version of Java (as of 2025, Java 23 is ideal).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://app.diagrams.net/">diagrams.net</a></strong>: This is a web app for creating
flowcharts and other diagrams. It can also integrate with Google Drive and
allow multiple people to edit the same diagram, but some students have
reported issues with lag while doing this.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-resources"><a class="header" href="#other-resources">Other Resources</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/23/docs//api/index.html">Java API</a>
is a useful reference. It may be intimidating right now, but the more you learn
about Java and programming in general, the more easily you'll be able to
navigate the API and use it to look up information.</p>
<p>Finally, asking good questions is one of the most useful skills you can have as
a student. In my experience, most people (myself included) don't ask questions
as often as they should, and it can be difficult to ask a question that will
quickly lead to a helpful answer. I think the blog posts below provide excellent
advice for asking and answering questions:</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="assignments"><a class="header" href="#assignments">Assignments</a></h1>
<h2 id="projects"><a class="header" href="#projects">Projects</a></h2>
<p>I will assign several projects during the semester, and I've created a separate
website covering the details of these projects. You will not receive a grade on
these projects; instead, individual projects are marked as complete or
incomplete depending on whether the work you submitted meets the requirements in
the assignment.</p>
<h2 id="project-submission"><a class="header" href="#project-submission">Project Submission</a></h2>
<p>In order for a project to count as complete, you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>submit the project on Blackboard</li>
<li>pack/format the submission as directed in the assignment</li>
<li>include every deliverable and meet every requirement listed in the assignment</li>
<li>submit the proposal, if one is required, at least two weeks before the project
and receive my approval for that proposal</li>
</ul>
<p>If a submission is marked incomplete, then you are allowed to resubmit before
the deadline. Both the incomplete submission and the new submission count
towards any limits on how often you can submit assignments.</p>
<h2 id="deadlines-and-restrictions"><a class="header" href="#deadlines-and-restrictions">Deadlines and Restrictions</a></h2>
<p>The following restrictions apply to submitting projects and project proposals:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can submit up to one project proposal and up to one project per week.</li>
<li>The cutoff for weekly proposal/project submissions is
11:59 PM ET on Sunday. If you submit after this time, then it
will count as your submission for the following week.</li>
<li>The latest you may submit a proposal is
11:59 PM ET on Sunday, April 27th, 2025. No new or revised proposals
are accepted after this deadline.</li>
<li>The latest you may submit a project is
11:59 PM ET on Thursday, May 8th, 2025 or the deadline given on that
assignment, whichever is earlier.</li>
</ul>
<p>I give specific times and enforce deadlines strictly to ensure I handle
assignment submissions consistently and fairly. It doesn't matter how close you
are to a missed deadline or what excuse you offer. You either submit the
assignment on time or arrange for an extension (see below); otherwise, I will
not accept your work. The only exception is projects submitted after a deadline
but before I download the submissions from Blackboard. This is a small window,
and I may choose to download the submissions at any time after the deadline.
Don't count on your project being accepted once the deadline has passed.</p>
<h2 id="extensions-and-other-exceptions"><a class="header" href="#extensions-and-other-exceptions">Extensions and Other Exceptions</a></h2>
<p>In rare cases (such as medical or family emergencies), I will allow an extension
to a deadline or an exception to another restriction on submitting an
assignment. You can email me to ask for a such an exception if you believe one
is appropriate in your situation. Your email should include an explanation of
why you need the extension, a new proposed deadline (or other proposed change to
existing restrictions), and your current progress on the assignment. Be sure to
send me your code and any other material you've created for the assignment so
far.</p>
<p>I have some expectations if I am going to give an extension or make an exception
to a class policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>You've demonstrated that you read this policy by including <em>all</em> of the
information I just asked for.</li>
<li>If you're having trouble with the assignment, then you've taken steps to get
help. Usually this means seeing a tutor or going to office hours.</li>
<li>You are clearly making an effort to keep up with the class and not
procrastinating. If there is an ongoing problem affecting your work or
participation in the class and you want me to accommodate you, then you must
let me know early and keep me informed as that situation develops.</li>
</ul>
<p>Extensions and other exceptions are given on a case-by-case basis. I will try to
be as fair as possible, but this comes down to my judgement and whether you've
been proactively communicating with me.</p>
<h2 id="other-assignments"><a class="header" href="#other-assignments">Other Assignments</a></h2>
<p>There will be other assignments in addition to the projects. For example, I may
ask you to read a section of my notes, view a video, or complete a practice
activity. While I may not deduct points from your grade if you miss these
assignments, these assignments help you acquire the necessary skills and
knowledge to complete the major projects, which means they can still
<em>indirectly</em> affect your final grade if you skip them. I try not to assign
unnecessary work, and I expect you to complete all assignments whether or not I
attach a grade to them.</p>
<h2 id="advice"><a class="header" href="#advice">Advice</a></h2>
<p>If you struggle with deadlines or time management, then I'd like to offer some
advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start your work early. The workload for any grade is manageable if you spread
it out, but it will be overwhelming if you let it pile up towards the end of
the semester.</li>
<li><strong>Deadlines in this class are not targets.</strong> If I give you a deadline, then
that is the latest I'm willing to accept the assignment under most
circumstances. If you plan to submit something the night it's due, then
there's a good chance you'll miss the deadline and receive no credit for your
work. Don't take that risk if you're not comfortable with the consequences.</li>
<li>There are people you can talk to if you need help, and the earlier you talk to
them the more they can do to help. Talk to someone when you <em>start</em> having
trouble; don't wait until you feel hopelessly stuck or overwhelmed.
<ul>
<li>I'm available by email and during

<li>The Learning Commons employs peer tutors who can help you with assignments
and academic coaches who help freshmen with time management and difficulties
adjusting to college.</li>

<li>Keep remote backups of your work! Google Drive and Dropbox both have free
plans, and I believe you can use OneDrive for free through your QU account.
You can also download old submissions from Blackboard.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="grading"><a class="header" href="#grading">Grading</a></h1>
<p>This class uses a labor-based grading system. While the idea of labor-based
grading may be unfamiliar to many students, the implementation in this class is
quite simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual assignments count as either complete or incomplete. You will not
get a numeric score or letter grade on any work you submit.</li>
<li>Your final grade is based on how many assignments you complete, as shown in
the table below.</li>
<li>At the end of the semester, you will receive the highest final grade for which
you meet every requirement.</li>
</ul>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Final Grade</th><th>Projects</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>A</td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>B</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>D</td><td>2</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>I've included a separate section that talks more about
<a href="./grading/labor_based_grading.html">labor-based grading</a> and my motivations for
using it in case you're curious. There's also a <a href="./grading/faq.html">FAQ</a> that
covers questions students have asked in the past or that I anticipate based on
how this system differs from more traditional grading.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="labor-based-grading"><a class="header" href="#labor-based-grading">Labor-Based Grading</a></h1>
<h2 id="what-is-labor-based-grading"><a class="header" href="#what-is-labor-based-grading">What is Labor-Based Grading?</a></h2>
<p>Labor-based grading and contract grading are approaches to grading that try to
emphasize the work you put into a class over the outcomes of that work. This
grading system specifies what work you need to complete to earn a particular
final grade, and individual assignments are not graded. You receive a final
grade based on what work you complete rather than a weighted average of grades
from assignments and exams.</p>
<p>There are plenty of articles online about labor-based grading if you want to
read about it in more detail. Here's one that was easy to find and that I think
explains the concept well: <a href="https://cep.barnard.edu/labor-based-grading">https://cep.barnard.edu/labor-based-grading</a>. This
article also links to an example grade contract. My implementation will differ,
but my goals are largely the same.</p>
<h2 id="why-labor-based-grading"><a class="header" href="#why-labor-based-grading">Why Labor-Based Grading?</a></h2>
<p>The author of the
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I9hjemH4qo5nQYa89WW-3udW-oz4cYDoly25m8yaiik/edit?usp=sharing">example grade contract</a>
shown in the Bernard College webpage gives an excellent explanation of why they
prefer contract grading over traditional grades. I recommend reading that if you
want to hear more about the motivation behind labor-based grading. I'll try to
summarize why I dislike traditional grading systems and think this system
addresses some (but not all) of the problems with grades.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grades are not a good source of feedback.</strong> Grades provide little
information on their own compared to comments and other qualitative feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Grades punish you for mistakes.</strong> Whether intended or not, low grades act as
a punishment. Mistakes are a necessary part of the learning process, and you
should not be penalized for them. Giving lower grades to indicate mistakes or
areas for improvement is counterproductive.</li>
<li><strong>A labor-based grading system is more transparent than a weighted average.</strong>
If you want a particular grade, then you know exactly which assignments you
must complete for that grade.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="faq"><a class="header" href="#faq">FAQ</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>If I'm not graded on an assignment, does that mean I don't need to put any
effort into it?</strong> I still review assignments and check that they were
completed as directed. You should expect the projects to challenge you and
require a significant amount of work to finish.</li>
<li><strong>Why can't I get an A+?</strong> QU's
<a href="https://catalog.qu.edu/academics/grading-system/">grading system</a> does not
include an A+. The highest grade you can earn in any QU class is an A.</li>
<li><strong>Why can't I get an A-, B+, B-, C+, or C-?</strong> I don't see a reason to include
an option for every in-between grade. An A is the highest grade you can earn,
a B is less demanding but still a good grade, and a C represents the minimum
requirements to pass this class and meet the prerequisite for other classes.</li>
<li><strong>Is there extra credit?</strong> No, there is not. Extra credit doesn't serve a
purpose in this grading system.</li>
<li><strong>Can I get partial credit on an assignment?</strong> There is no partial credit for
late or incomplete assignments. You must complete the entire assignment,
submit it on time, and submit it in the correct format to receive credit for
it. If you're having trouble, then please ask me or a tutor for help.</li>
<li><strong>Are there exams?</strong> Graded exams, quizzes, and similar assessments don't work
with this grading system. There are no exams, not even a final exam. However,
I may give ungraded quizzes as a way for you to check your understanding of
topics we've covered.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have questions about the grading system that aren't answered here, then
please don't hesitate to ask me about it! I want you to feel comfortable with
the grading system and understand what's required to earn the grade you want.</p>

<p>I highly recommend making use of the Learning Commons any time you need help
with work for this class. There should be several peer tutors available for
computer science and software engineering courses. The Learning Commons also
employs academic coaches who work with first-year students.</p>
<p>Below is some additional information about the Learning Commons and their
contact information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Learning Commons is a place for students to go when they want to achieve a
level of performance they can’t reach on their own. In a setting of practice
and growth, student resources are provided through Peer Educator programs, the
Office of Student Accessibility, and Academic Development &amp; Outreach
professional staff. The Learning Commons can be found at the Mount Carmel
Campus in the North wing of the Arnold Bernhard Library; and at the North
Haven Campus on the third floor of the Law School (SLE-340). Students are
encouraged to visit The Learning Commons for support with class content, to
improve study skills, to consult on academic success strategies, and for
general developmental advising needs.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to add that your mental and physical health are more important
than your classes. If you're struggling with class due to mental health issues
or notice that you're developing unhealthy habits to cope with your workload,
then please talk to someone as early as possible. I'll try to work with you if
you tell me about a problem you're experiencing, and the earlier we talk the

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="academic-integrity-ai-policy"><a class="header" href="#academic-integrity-ai-policy">Academic Integrity (AI) Policy</a></h1>
<p>Here is a link to Quinnipiac University's Academic Integrity (AI) policy:
<a href="https://catalog.qu.edu/university-policies/academic-integrity-policy/">https://catalog.qu.edu/university-policies/academic-integrity-policy/</a>. The
policy applies to all courses at QU, and this part of the syllabus goes into
detail about how the policy is enforced in our class. From this point forward I
will assume you are familiar with the school's AI policy.</p>
<p>The following sections cover common situations in which AI violations occur, how
to comply with the AI policy in those situations, and some advice based on my
experience dealing with AI violations.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./ai/sharing.html">Sharing Work</a></li>
<li><a href="./ai/help.html">Asking for Help</a></li>
<li><a href="./ai/group.html">Group Assignments</a></li>
<li><a href="./ai/sources.html">Using Other Sources</a></li>
<li><a href="./ai/llm.html">Artificial Intelligence</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The final section covers how I handle AI violations in this class:
<a href="./ai/violations.html">Academic Integrity Violations</a>.</p>
<h2 id="general-advice"><a class="header" href="#general-advice">General Advice</a></h2>
<p>When in doubt, ask questions <strong>before</strong> you do something that may violate the AI
policy!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="sharing-work"><a class="header" href="#sharing-work">Sharing Work</a></h1>
<p>There are many legitimate reasons that you may want to publish or share your
work on an assignment. To list a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making code publicly available on a site like GitHub as part of a portfolio or
to provided it as a learning resource for other programmers</li>
<li>Comparing your code with someone else's code to learn from their approach to
solving the same problem</li>
<li>Asking for assistance or feedback while working on an assignment</li>
</ul>
<p>I consider it important that you are allowed to share work for any legitimate
reason, and this matters more to me than trying to punish or discourage sharing
for illegitimate reasons. If you tell me that you shared work in good faith,
then I'll take your word for it unless you give me a reason not to.</p>
<h2 id="academic-integrity-requirements"><a class="header" href="#academic-integrity-requirements">Academic Integrity Requirements</a></h2>
<p>To comply with the AI policy when sharing work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be honest if asked who you shared your work with.</li>
<li>Do not share work with someone who has stated or implied that they plan to
copy that work or otherwise use it to violate the AI policy.</li>
<li>When posting work online, do not post it in a manner that encourages others to
copy it or otherwise violate the AI policy. For example, posting your projects
and advertising them as the solutions to a class's programming assignments may
imply that they were posted for other people to copy.</li>
</ul>
<p>You have my permission to share any and all work you do <em>in this class</em>, and you
will not be responsible for anyone else's misuse of that shared work as long as
you follow the above rules.</p>
<h2 id="advice-1"><a class="header" href="#advice-1">Advice</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Credit yourself as the author of any programs you write.</li>
<li>Don't share your work with someone unless you're confident that they don't
plan on copying it. While I don't consider it your job to ensure other
students don't cheat off you, I don't think it's hard to guess when someone
just wants your work so they can copy it. You'll still be dragged into the AI
case when they get caught, and it's not going to be a fun process for you.</li>
<li>If you tell me that you shared your work with another student, then you are
<strong>not</strong> implicating the person who you shared it with. If you think they did
violate the AI policy, then lying about your involvement is itself a violation
and will not protect the other student from consequences. If you don't think
they violated the AI policy, then there is no reason to deny having shared
work with them.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="asking-for-help"><a class="header" href="#asking-for-help">Asking for Help</a></h1>
<p>You are allowed to ask anyone for help with any assignment in this class unless
that assignment's directions say otherwise. This means you can talk to me, other
instructors, tutors, classmates, friends, relatives, etc. as long as they're
willing to spend their time helping you. You can learn a lot by talking to other
programmers, and I want to encourage you to ask for help as often as you need
it.</p>
<h2 id="academic-integrity-requirements-1"><a class="header" href="#academic-integrity-requirements-1">Academic Integrity Requirements</a></h2>
<p>To comply with the AI policy when receiving assistance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acknowledge anyone who provided significant assistance at the beginning of
your program and note how they assisted. "Significant assistance" means
anything that took more than a few minutes. If you're not sure whether
someone's help qualified as significant, then play it safe and credit them.</li>
<li>When you need help with an assignment and are talking to someone more
knowledgeable (such as a professor, tutor, or someone who already finished the
assignment):
<ul>
<li>Do not copy or paraphrase the other person's code, and do not view their
code while writing yours. If someone is helping you, then your job is to ask
good questions and gain a better understanding of the problem you're trying
to solve or the techniques required to solve it. Use that understanding to
write your own code and solve the problem your way. There are numerous ways
to write any program, even something as simple as Hello World.</li>
<li>Do not rely on the other person to tell you what to type or how to write
your program. If they're explaining the solution and you're just copying
down what they say, then you aren't writing your own code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you and another student are both working on the same assignment and
assisting each other:
<ul>
<li>Make sure you are both writing your own separate programs. You should not be
writing one program together, copying each other, or otherwise sharing code.
Each person's program must be entirely their own work. Being allowed to ask
other people for help does not mean everything is a group project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When asking for feedback or assistance with debugging:
<ul>
<li>The other person should not be fixing your code for you. You can ask them to
help you find the problem, explain why something isn't working, or explain
how to fix your program, but you should be the one fixing it. You need to
understand the problem so that you can more easily recognize and fix it on
your own in the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize: whether or not someone else is helping you, you always need to
complete your own work. Allowing someone to do your work for you or using their
work in your assignment is a violation of the AI policy.</p>
<h2 id="advice-2"><a class="header" href="#advice-2">Advice</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Don't ask someone for their code when you're struggling to write yours. Seeing
a solution will just bias you towards imitating what they did, which will
qualify as copying, cheating, and/or plagiarism. Possessing another person's
work in this class does not violate the AI policy on its own, but it's
unlikely to help you do anything other than cheat.</li>
<li>If you aren't sure whether you relied too much on the other person's
assistance when coding, then try rewriting that part of the program from
scratch (and don't just try to recreate the previous solution from memory). If
you understand how to solve the problem and apply the relevant programming
concepts, then this should be easy. When writing a program, most of the work
is understanding a problem and designing a solution, not writing it down.</li>
<li>It's not the other person's responsibility to avoid providing too much
assistance; it's your responsibility to do your own work. You need to convey
to them what you're having trouble with and how you want them to help.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="group-assignments"><a class="header" href="#group-assignments">Group Assignments</a></h1>
<p>Some assignments may allow for group work on all or part of the assignment.
<strong>This is not the default, and any assignment that allows group work will state
that group work is allowed and on which parts you may work as a group.</strong> If an
assignment doesn't mention group work, then it's not group work.</p>
<h2 id="academic-integrity-requirements-2"><a class="header" href="#academic-integrity-requirements-2">Academic Integrity Requirements</a></h2>
<p>To comply with the AI policy when working on group assignments:</p>
<ul>
<li>All group members must be credited on the assignment. It must be clear that
they are members of the group and co-authors of the work being submitted, as
opposed to someone who assisted (see <a href="ai/./help.html">Asking for Help</a>) or a source
whose work was quoted or used in the assignment (see
<a href="ai/./sources.html">Using Other Sources</a>). Failing to credit a group member
violates the university's AI policy.</li>
<li>All group members must make significant contributions to a group assignment,
and work must be divided <em>reasonably</em> evenly among all group members. If
someone does significantly less work than the rest of the group, then they
cannot be counted as part of the group. Crediting someone for work they did
not do violates the university's AI policy.</li>
<li>Keep track of everyone's contributions. If a group needs to remove a member,
then that member's work can no longer be used in the project. If you leave a
group or the group dissolves entirely, then you are no longer allowed to use
any work contributed by the other members.</li>
<li>All group members are responsible for communicating with one another and for
all work submitted by the group. You should be familiar with the entire
project and comfortable having your name attached to it. If this group work
violates the AI policy (for example, if part of it is plagiarized), then every
group member may bear some responsibility depending on the circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="advice-3"><a class="header" href="#advice-3">Advice</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>If you choose to work with someone else on a project, then you are choosing to
be partially responsible for that person. Don't take this lightly, and don't
continue working with someone if they violate your trust or if you think their
behavior will cause problems for you.</li>
<li>Pay attention to which parts of a project are group work and which are not. A
project may have some group components and some individual components.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="using-other-sources"><a class="header" href="#using-other-sources">Using Other Sources</a></h1>
<p>By default, all work submitted in this class must be entirely your own work.
This section covers the requirements for using work that is not yours in an
assignment.</p>
<h2 id="academic-integrity-requirements-3"><a class="header" href="#academic-integrity-requirements-3">Academic Integrity Requirements</a></h2>
<p>First, the following are always acceptable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code or other material intentionally provided with an assignment can be used
freely, and you don't need to include any credit for this material.
<ul>
<li>If material was obviously included by accident (for example, an entire
solution was posted with the assignment), then submitting the material as
though it was your own work may be treated as cheating or plagiarism.</li>
<li>If material was included by accident (obvious or not), then I will remove
the material as soon as I am aware of it and notify the class. If you used
the material assuming it was posted intentionally, then you will be allowed
to update and resubmit the assignment without that material.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If I provide material outside of an assignment, such as my notes or an
in-class example, then you are free to use it in any assignment for this
class. The material should still be credited as mentioned below.</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, to comply with the AI policy when using other sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>If copying, paraphrasing, or basing your work on material from another source:
<ul>
<li>You must have my written permission (an email is sufficient) to use that
material in your assignment. I may grant permission in the assignment
directions, but if not then you'll need to ask me ahead of time.</li>
<li>All work that is not your own must be clearly credited. You must specify
which part(s) of the assignment are from another source, which source it was
from, and link to or otherwise provide a means to check the original source.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you are using another source for help without copying, paraphrasing, or
basing your work on the material in that source:
<ul>
<li>You must credit the source as you would credit someone who provided
assistance, as noted in the <a href="ai/./help.html">Asking for Help</a> section.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Last, a note about "double-dipping" and self-plagiarism:</p>
<p>To quote the university's AI policy, double-dipping refers to "<em>multiple uses of
the same work</em>" or "<em>presenting the same or substantially the same written work
(or portion thereof) as part of the course requirement for more than one project
or course, without the express prior written permission of the instructor(s)
involved</em>." I'm usually okay with you reusing work in other classes or using
work from another class in my class, but you still need written permission from
both me and the other instructor.</p>
<p>If you are retaking this class, then I expect you to complete every assignment
from scratch without reusing any of your old work. I consider reusing work from
the last time you took this class to be another form of double-dipping.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="artificial-intelligence"><a class="header" href="#artificial-intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a></h1>
<p>While I don't advise using services marketed as "artificial intelligence" to
assist with work for classes, especially introductory classes, I'll save that
for the advice section. You're free to use these services as long as you follow
the rules given below.</p>
<p>To avoid confusion, I'll refer to any artificial intelligence service as an LLM
(large language model, which describes ChatGPT and similar services currently
available) and continue using AI to abbreviate "academic integrity."</p>
<h2 id="academic-integrity-requirements-4"><a class="header" href="#academic-integrity-requirements-4">Academic Integrity Requirements</a></h2>
<p>To comply with the AI policy when using an LLM:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must use an interface that keeps a record of your conversation and allows
you to share a link to the entire conversation. For example,
<a href="https://chatgpt.com">https://chatgpt.com</a> (as of 2025/01/08) includes a "Share" button near the
top-right of the conversation panel. Ask the LLM to state the current date at
the beginning of this conversation to verify when the interaction took place.
You may be asked to share the conversation again if this use of the LLM is
suspected to violate the academic integrity policy, so don't use it to discuss
anything that you're not comfortable sharing later. If you cannot provide a
link to the conversation record, then you are not permitted to use it to
assist with any assignments in this class.</li>
<li>You must state at the beginning of your program that you used an LLM to assist
you when working on the assignment, summarize how it assisted you, and include
a link to the entire conversation(s) in which this assistance took place (see
above).</li>
<li>You may not use any material (code, text, images, etc.) generated by the LLM
in your work. Any use of the LLM must follow the guidelines given in other
sections regarding <a href="ai/./help.html">Asking for Help</a> and
<a href="ai/./sources.html">Using Other Sources</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="advice-4"><a class="header" href="#advice-4">Advice</a></h2>
<p>I recommend against any use of LLMs in this class for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>An LLM is not intelligent and does not understand the conversation you are
having with it. It is prone to hallucinating (making up false information),
and it does not know or care when it is hallucinating. As a tool, it is most
useful when you have the expertise to verify factual claims and code generated
by the LLM. Don't rely on an LLM to explain something to you if you don't
understand the topic well enough to critically evaluate its explanation.</li>
<li>When learning to program or learning new programming concepts, you have to
start practicing with relatively small and simple problems. An LLM has seen
hundreds of thousands of examples like these and can easily give you a working
solution. If you could learn a new skill by just viewing the solutions to
problems, then we would give you the solutions instead of asking you to create
them yourself. You will not learn unless you practice solving problems, and
you will not be able to attempt the more complex problems if you rely on an
LLM to solve the simple problems for you.</li>
<li>The point of this class is to teach you about computer science and software
engineering topics. This is not a course on "prompt engineering". If you
believe that an LLM will be crucial to your future career as a programmer,
then becoming an expert in programming will put you in the best position to
utilize an LLM in that career.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="academic-integrity-violations"><a class="header" href="#academic-integrity-violations">Academic Integrity Violations</a></h1>
<p>This section covers how I typically handle AI violations. The full procedure is
covered in the university's AI policy, so this will just cover details relevant
to our class and my own habits.</p>
<h2 id="investigation"><a class="header" href="#investigation">Investigation</a></h2>
<p>If I believe that you have committed an AI violation or that your work was used
in an AI violation, then I will contact you to ask for more information after
I've gathered the necessary evidence. I don't like to pursue suspected
violations unless I see conclusive evidence that a violation took place, so you
are not likely to convince me of anything by lying at this point.</p>
<p>If you did not violate the AI policy, then this is your opportunity to clear any
suspicion by providing additional evidence and letting me know about any work
you have shared with other students. Knowing the original author of plagiarized
work allows me to argue that the original author does not bear responsibility
for the violation due to the <a href="ai/./sharing.html">Sharing Work</a> section of this
syllabus. If you decide to lie about sharing work and later claim to have shared
that work in good faith, then I will not believe you.</p>
<p>If you have violated the AI policy, then it's probably too late to avoid getting
in trouble once I contact you about the violation. You can cooperate, in which
case we can discuss the AI process and attempt a joint resolution (if allowed)
after I file the report. If you appear to be lying or decide not to cooperate,
then I'm not going to continue talking to you about the violation and will not
likely consider a joint resolution, even if later decide to accept
responsibility for the violation.</p>
<h2 id="consequences-for-ai-violations"><a class="header" href="#consequences-for-ai-violations">Consequences for AI Violations</a></h2>
<p>This section covers what I believe are appropriate consequences <em>on a first
offense</em> for most AI violations. The university's AI policy explains the
procedure for determining consequences.</p>
<ul>
<li>If some or all of an assignment you submitted wasn't your own work, then you
should not receive any credit for the assignment or be allowed to resubmit it.
You would not normally receive credit for completing only part of the
assignment without cheating, so to give any credit would be a reward for the
AI violation. This is to remain consistent with my grading policy, and I do
not view it as the primary sanction.</li>
<li>Your final grade should be further reduced by one letter per violation of the
AI policy. For this purpose, I would treat cheating on two assignments or
helping someone cheat on two assignments to be two separate violations, and as
a result this would lower your final grade by two letters.</li>
<li>If the above sanction would lower your grade below an F, then you should
instead receive a final grade of FAI.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the syllabus needs to be revised, then any changes will be noted here. I will
also keep older versions of the syllabus available on Blackboard so that there
is a clear record of all changes.</p>
