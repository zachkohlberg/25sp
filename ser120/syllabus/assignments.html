<h2 id="projects"><a class="header" href="#projects">Projects</a></h2>
<p>I will assign several projects during the semester, and I've created a separate
website covering the details of these projects. You will not receive a grade on
these projects; instead, individual projects are marked as complete or
incomplete depending on whether the work you submitted meets the requirements in
the assignment.</p>
<h2 id="project-submission"><a class="header" href="#project-submission">Project Submission</a></h2>
<p>In order for a project to count as complete, you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>submit the project on Blackboard</li>
<li>pack/format the submission as directed in the assignment</li>
<li>include every deliverable and meet every requirement listed in the assignment</li>
<li>submit the proposal, if one is required, at least two weeks before the project
and receive my approval for that proposal</li>
</ul>
<p>If a submission is marked incomplete, then you are allowed to resubmit before
the deadline. Both the incomplete submission and the new submission count
towards any limits on how often you can submit assignments.</p>
<h2 id="deadlines-and-restrictions"><a class="header" href="#deadlines-and-restrictions">Deadlines and Restrictions</a></h2>
<p>The following restrictions apply to submitting projects and project proposals:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can submit up to one project proposal and up to one project per week.</li>
<li>The cutoff for weekly proposal/project submissions is
11:59 PM ET on Sunday. If you submit after this time, then it
will count as your submission for the following week.</li>
<li>The latest you may submit a proposal is
11:59 PM ET on Sunday, April 27th, 2025. No new or revised proposals
are accepted after this deadline.</li>
<li>The latest you may submit a project is
11:59 PM ET on Thursday, May 8th, 2025 or the deadline given on that
assignment, whichever is earlier.</li>
</ul>
<p>I give specific times and enforce deadlines strictly to ensure I handle
assignment submissions consistently and fairly. It doesn't matter how close you
are to a missed deadline or what excuse you offer. You either submit the
assignment on time or arrange for an extension (see below); otherwise, I will
not accept your work. The only exception is projects submitted after a deadline
but before I download the submissions from Blackboard. This is a small window,
and I may choose to download the submissions at any time after the deadline.
Don't count on your project being accepted once the deadline has passed.</p>
<h2 id="extensions-and-other-exceptions"><a class="header" href="#extensions-and-other-exceptions">Extensions and Other Exceptions</a></h2>
<p>In rare cases (such as medical or family emergencies), I will allow an extension
to a deadline or an exception to another restriction on submitting an
assignment. You can email me to ask for a such an exception if you believe one
is appropriate in your situation. Your email should include an explanation of
why you need the extension, a new proposed deadline (or other proposed change to
existing restrictions), and your current progress on the assignment. Be sure to
send me your code and any other material you've created for the assignment so
far.</p>
<p>I have some expectations if I am going to give an extension or make an exception
to a class policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>You've demonstrated that you read this policy by including <em>all</em> of the
information I just asked for.</li>
<li>If you're having trouble with the assignment, then you've taken steps to get
help. Usually this means seeing a tutor or going to office hours.</li>
<li>You are clearly making an effort to keep up with the class and not
procrastinating. If there is an ongoing problem affecting your work or
participation in the class and you want me to accommodate you, then you must
let me know early and keep me informed as that situation develops.</li>
</ul>
<p>Extensions and other exceptions are given on a case-by-case basis. I will try to
be as fair as possible, but this comes down to my judgement and whether you've
been proactively communicating with me.</p>
<h2 id="other-assignments"><a class="header" href="#other-assignments">Other Assignments</a></h2>
<p>There will be other assignments in addition to the projects. For example, I may
ask you to read a section of my notes, view a video, or complete a practice
activity. While I may not deduct points from your grade if you miss these
assignments, these assignments help you acquire the necessary skills and
knowledge to complete the major projects, which means they can still
<em>indirectly</em> affect your final grade if you skip them. I try not to assign
unnecessary work, and I expect you to complete all assignments whether or not I
attach a grade to them.</p>
<h2 id="advice"><a class="header" href="#advice">Advice</a></h2>
<p>If you struggle with deadlines or time management, then I'd like to offer some
advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start your work early. The workload for any grade is manageable if you spread
it out, but it will be overwhelming if you let it pile up towards the end of
the semester.</li>
<li><strong>Deadlines in this class are not targets.</strong> If I give you a deadline, then
that is the latest I'm willing to accept the assignment under most
circumstances. If you plan to submit something the night it's due, then
there's a good chance you'll miss the deadline and receive no credit for your
work. Don't take that risk if you're not comfortable with the consequences.</li>
<li>There are people you can talk to if you need help, and the earlier you talk to
them the more they can do to help. Talk to someone when you <em>start</em> having
trouble; don't wait until you feel hopelessly stuck or overwhelmed.
<ul>
<li>I'm available by email and during
<a href="./communication.html#office-hours">office hours</a>.</li>
<li>The Learning Commons employs peer tutors who can help you with assignments
and academic coaches who help freshmen with time management and difficulties
adjusting to college.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keep remote backups of your work! Google Drive and Dropbox both have free
plans, and I believe you can use OneDrive for free through your QU account.
You can also download old submissions from Blackboard.</li>
</ul>
